                'return',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'When Do Favors Expire?',
 'text': 'Life is full of trading favors. We assist a colleague who is racing '
         'to meet a looming work deadline, or we babysit for a fellow parent '
         'in a pinch, or we help a friend move a piece of furniture—and then, '
         'eventually, we ask for something in return. But once we offer that '
         'favor, if we’re hoping for payback, how long should we wait before '
         'we make our request? Social mores seem to dictate that we let an '
         'appropriate amount of time pass before we make our move; if we ask '
         'too soon, we may come off as gauche. Maybe our colleague, fellow '
         'parent, or friend will think our initial act was purely '
         'instrumental, only taken to initiate a quid pro quo. But new work we '
         'published earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National '
         'Academy of Sciences suggests that if we want something done in '
         'return for our good deed, we cannot ask too soon.\n'
         'We analyzed a setting where favor exchange is a billion dollar '
         'business: How a hospital that does its patients the “favor” of '
         'providing high-quality care can best time its requests for the '
         '“favor” of a charitable donation.\xa0 While this context may feel '
         'far-removed from the quid pro quo involved in exchanging favors with '
         'colleagues, friends and family, past research on reciprocity '
         'suggests the same principles likely apply.\n'
         'Specifically, we analyzed data on over 18,000 donation requests made '
         'by a large university hospital system of its former patients.\xa0 '
         'These requests were all made by mail, after a patient’s first-ever '
         'outpatient visit to the medical center. To assess whether a speedy '
         'ask from the hospital for a donation from former patients was a good '
         'idea, we took advantage of a quirk in how donation requests were '
         'mailed to patients. Solicitations were sent in batches, so that all '
         'solicited patients who first visited the hospital in the same '
         'two-month window (for example, March or April of 2013) were sent '
         'letters on the same date. This quirk often leads to drastic '
         'differences in the time between a hospital visit and a donation '
         'request. For example, two patients of the same age, gender, and race '
         'who both visited the hospital’s oncology department one day apart '
         'could have completely different experiences with the hospital when '
         'it comes to receiving an ask for a donation. If the first patient '
         'just made a mailing cutoff that the second patient barely missed, '
         'the first would get her solicitation a few short weeks after her '
         'hospital visit while the second would receive it several months '
         'later. We asked: Does reciprocity decay over time or hold steady? '
         'Does asking for a quid pro quo backfire when you ask too early?\xa0\n'
         'What we find is a steep decay in people’s willingness to donate. For '
         'every additional month separating the provision of medical care from '
         'a donation solicitation, a patient’s likelihood of responding with a '
         'gift declines by 30 percent.\xa0 The drop-off is fastest for '
         'patients who visited hospital departments that tend to treat '
         'patients with the most severe ailments—the oncology, surgery, and '
         'cardiology departments.\xa0 This helps rule out the possibility that '
         'patients are just forgetting that they ever interacted with the '
         'medical center, as it’s unlikely oncology, surgery, and cardiology '
         'patients forgot about their visits.\xa0 The data includes some '
         'solicitations that arrive just days after medical care, and we see '
         'no evidence of backlash from sending the request for a return favor '
         'too soon. All evidence points to sooner being better.\n'
         'What should we all make of this? What does data from a hospital '
         'system tell us more generally? We analyzed patients who received '
         'medical care, but their motivations for making a charitable gift to '
         'the hospital system that treated them are likely triggered by a '
         'reciprocal motive—a feeling of appreciation for what the staff, '
         'nurses, and doctors have done. This kind of reciprocity is at the '
         'heart of a wide range of our daily acts, from volunteering and '
         'charitable giving, to tipping, to favor exchange. While we analyzed '
         'data from a health care setting, the reciprocal motive that drives '
         'behavior is central to all these interactions. And while it has been '
         'typically assumed that willingness to reciprocate is fairly stable, '
         'we find evidence to the contrary.\xa0\n'
         'This is particularly important news for organizations that survive '
         'in part on donations from former recipients of services like '
         'hospitals, churches, humane societies, and schools.\xa0 Delays in '
         'their requests for donations turn out to be extremely costly.\xa0 '
         'But it is likely true for friends and colleagues as well.\xa0 We '
         'should not assume that a favor done will be returned with interest, '
         'but rather recognize that feelings of reciprocity fade quickly. If '
         'we aren’t being generous entirely out of the goodness of our hearts '
         'but instead harbor a hope that one good turn will earn another, we '
         'should not delay in asking for what we need back!\n'
         'So, when you step in as a babysitter for a friend, ask them to be on '
         'duty for your next date night. When you pitch in to help a colleague '
         'with a project, do not delay in requesting their help in meeting '
         'your next deadline. And if you visit a hospital, do not be surprised '
         'if they ask you for a donation sooner than you might expect.\n',

 'text': 'Every morning, Avigael Wodinsky sets a timer to keep her 12-year-old '
         'son, Naftali, on track while he gets dressed for school. '
         '“Otherwise,” she says, “he’ll find 57 other things to do on the way '
         'to the bathroom.”\n'
         'Wodinsky says she knew something was different about Naftali from '
         'the time he was born, long before his autism diagnosis at 15 months. '
         'He lagged behind his twin sister in hitting developmental '
         'milestones, and he seemed distant. “When he was an infant and he was '
         'feeding, he wouldn’t cry if you took the bottle away from him,” she '
         'says. He often sat facing the corner, turning the pages of a picture '
         'book over and over again. Although he has above-average '
         'intelligence, he did not speak much until he was 4, and even then '
         'his speech was often ‘scripted:’ He would repeat phrases and '
         'sentences he had heard on television.\n'
         'Naftali’s trouble with maintaining focus became apparent in '
         'preschool—and problematic in kindergarten. He would stare out the '
         'window or wander around the classroom. “He was doing everything '
         'except what he was supposed to be doing,” Wodinsky recalls. At '
         'first, his psychiatrist credited these behaviors to his autism and '
         'recommended he drink coffee for its mild stimulant effect. The '
         'psychiatrist also suggested anxiety drugs. Neither treatment helped. '
         'A doctor then prescribed a series of drugs used for attention '
         'deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even though Naftali’s '
         'hyperactivity was still considered a part of his autism; those '
         'medications also failed or caused intolerable side effects.\n'
         'Finally, when Naftali was 7, another doctor had Naftali’s mother and '
         'teachers fill out assessments of his behavior and concluded that '
         'Naftali has ADHD as well as autism.\n'
         'Until about five years ago, the American Psychiatric Association’s '
         'diagnostic bible held the two conditions to be mutually exclusive: '
         'Only in 2013, with the debut of the current “Diagnostic and '
         'Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” (DSM-5), did\xa0a dual '
         'diagnosis\xa0become permissible. But in fact, autism and ADHD often '
         'coincide. An estimated 30 to 80 percent of children with autism\xa0'
         'also meet the criteria for ADHD\xa0and, conversely, 20 to 50 percent '
         'of children with ADHD for autism. Given the size of the overlap, '
         'scientists are beginning to rethink the relationship between the two '
         'conditions and to look for\xa0common biological roots.\n'
         'The connections could run deep. One team in the Netherlands has '
         'proposed that autism and ADHD are different manifestations of a\xa0'
         'single condition\xa0with a range of subtypes, each having a distinct '
         'time of onset, mix of traits and progression. In this view, ADHD can '
         'occur without signs of autism, but autism always occurs with '
         'features of ADHD or other conditions, notes the team’s leader\xa0Jan '
         'Buitelaar, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Radboud '
         'University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\n'
         'However tempting the ‘one-condition’ idea may seem, the evidence is '
         'far from conclusive. A growing number of genetic studies support the '
         'notion of at least\xa0some shared causation\xa0between autism and '
         'ADHD. But imaging studies comparing brain structures and '
         'connectivity have yielded a confusing mix of similarities and '
         'differences. And some behavioral research has highlighted the '
         'possibility that outwardly similar features mask distinct underlying '
         'mechanisms. Inattention in a person with autism, for example, might '
         'result from sensory overload, and apparent social problems in '
         'someone with ADHD may reflect impulsivity.\n'
         '“Are we looking at one condition that’s on a continuum, or two '
         'distinct conditions? I think we don’t know the answer to that '
         'question,” says\xa0Geraldine Dawson, director of the Duke Center for '
         'Autism and Brain Development. “There hasn’t really been enough '
         'systematic research.”\n'
         'Understanding how the two conditions intersect may, in any case, '
         'lead to improved therapies—a pressing need. People who have traits '
         'that stretch across both autism and ADHD diagnoses often face more '
         'serious challenges than people with either diagnosis alone: They can '
         'have\xa0greater impairments\xa0in adaptive functioning, a term that '
         'refers to self-care and daily living skills, and more severe\xa0'
         'social and cognitive\xa0issues.\n'
         'The idea that autism and ADHD are intrinsically entwined stems not '
         'just from their frequent co-occurrence, but from observations that '
         'they share behavioral features. The core diagnostic criteria for the '
         'conditions remain distinct in the DSM-5: social communication '
         'impairments plus restricted and\xa0repetitive behaviors\xa0for '
         'autism; and inattention or hyperactivity and impulsivity, or a '
         'combination, for ADHD. But both conditions can involve delays in '
         'language, heightened sensory responses, defiant behavior, problems '
         'with regulating emotions and difficulty with planning and with '
         'inhibiting behavior. Both also appear in childhood and are\xa0more '
         'often diagnosed in boys.\n'
         'Some of the strongest support for shared roots comes from studies of '
         'families and twins, which indicate that relatives of people with '
         'either condition have an increased risk of having both. For '
         'instance, firstborn children of women with ADHD face a\xa0sixfold '
         'risk of also having ADHD\xa0and more than double the risk of having '
         'autism compared with the general population, according to a 2014 '
         'study.\n'
         'Last year, another team considered the risks in reverse. Reviewing '
         'medical data from nearly 2 million people born in Sweden, they found '
         'that individuals with autism and their extended family members\xa0'
         'have an elevated risk\xa0of ADHD. As would be expected for highly '
         'heritable conditions, ADHD risk is highest among identical twins of '
         'people with autism, and is elevated even in cousins. The heightened '
         'vulnerability in cousins strengthens the idea of a genetic '
         'connection between the two conditions—because cousins are typically '
         'more genetically alike than nonrelatives but less likely than twins '
         'to have had the same environmental exposures early in development.\n'
         'These results indicate that at least some shared genetic risk '
         'factors underpin both conditions. But the picture becomes murkier at '
         'the level of individual genes.\n'
         'Autism and ADHD are both thought to involve multiple genes, many of '
         'which may individually exert small effects. Also, both conditions '
         'are heterogeneous, meaning the specific genes involved can differ '
         'from person to person. Adding to the complexity, the nature of the '
         'genetic influences can also vary. Some risk factors are so-called '
         'common variants—versions of genes that appear in more than 1 percent '
         'of the population. Unpublished research posted on the preprint '
         'server bioRxiv in November is among the first to find evidence of '
         'an\xa0overlap in common variants\xa0between people with autism and '
         'those with ADHD. Other risk variants are rare and tend to occur '
         'spontaneously, or may be inherited. Common and rare variants can '
         'both involve anything from single DNA letters to larger chromosomal '
         'segments encompassing multiple genes.\n'
         '“Genetic studies of both common and rare variants are beginning to '
         'show that risk for ADHD and [autism] is at least partly shared,” '
         'says\xa0Joanna Martin, a researcher at Cardiff University in Wales, '
         'who studies the genetic risk of neurodevelopmental conditions. '
         'Still, scientists have yet to make a strong case implicating any '
         'particular\xa0genetic variant in both autism and ADHD. “Studies so '
         'far have been underpowered to conclusively identify specific risk '
         'variants that are shared,” Martin says.\n'
         'One of the latest discoveries is that a certain kind of mutation, '
         'called a truncating mutation, is more\xa0common in people who have '
         'autism, ADHD\xa0or both than it is in controls. In these rare '
         'mutations, a change in a single DNA base leads to an incomplete, and '
         'potentially malfunctioning, protein. A 2017 study examined sequences '
         'from the coding genomes of about 8,000 infants with autism, ADHD or '
         'both and more than 5,000 typical infants. A statistical analysis '
         'implied that many of the mutations occur in the same genes in both '
         'autism and ADHD, although it did not specify which ones.\n'
         'For all the buzz around the ‘shared-origins’ idea, the quest to find '
         'common roots could fall short. Evidence drawn from genetics, brain '
         'imaging and behavioral research all give reason to question whether '
         'autism and ADHD are related below the surface.\n'
         'One genetic study last year focused on people with ‘sporadic’ ADHD, '
         'who have no relatives with the condition. The team first sequenced '
         'the coding genomes of 11 children and their parents, and found six '
         'noninherited mutations in 4 of the children. They then looked at '
         'whether the same 11 children, plus 117 others with sporadic ADHD, '
         'carry mutations in the coding regions of 26 genes\xa0previously tied '
         'to autism\xa0or intellectual disability. A mutation in only one of '
         'these genes appeared in a child with ADHD. The result “does not rule '
         'out some overlap but suggests that the origins may largely differ,” '
         'says lead investigator\xa0Gail Jarvik, head of the medical genetics '
         'division at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n'
         'The case for shared causation is also difficult to nail down on '
         'anatomical grounds. Imaging studies paint a hazy picture of whether '
         'shared brain features contribute to autism and ADHD.\n'
         'In 2016, researchers reviewed 23 years of structural\xa0'
         'brain-imaging studies\xa0in people with autism, ADHD or both. The '
         'studies examined the volume of different brain regions and assessed '
         'the integrity of the wiring in various areas. “Based on our review, '
         'we found both shared and different brain alterations in [autism] and '
         'ADHD,” says\xa0Andrew Michael\xa0of the Autism and Developmental '
         'Medicine Institute at Geisinger, based in Pennsylvania.\n'
         'For instance, the team noted that, in general, people with one or '
         'both conditions have less robust wiring in the\xa0corpus callosum, '
         'which joins the brain’s two hemispheres, and in the\xa0cerebellum, '
         'which is involved in motor control and cognition. Both structures '
         'also tend to be smaller than usual in individuals with these '
         'conditions. At the same time, people with autism, but not those with '
         'ADHD, tend to have a large amygdala, which plays a role in\xa0'
         'anxiety, fear and social behaviors. And the total brain volume is '
         'also likely to be bigger in people with autism and smaller in those '
         'with ADHD, compared with controls.\n'
         'Buitelaar and his colleagues have also reviewed brain imaging '
         'studies of people with autism or ADHD. They, too, saw a mix of '
         'findings, which they acknowledge are difficult to interpret. In '
         'keeping with their ‘one-condition’ hypothesis, though, they '
         'concluded that\xa0brain maturation\xa0in both conditions proceeds '
         'differently or is delayed compared with typical individuals. They '
         'hypothesize that distinct patterns of thinning in certain brain '
         'regions might help them to distinguish subtypes of their proposed '
         'autism-ADHD spectrum.\n'
         'Imaging data aside, yet another fault line runs through the '
         'shared-origins idea: Behaviors that look similar in people with '
         'autism or ADHD may be unrelated, according to a 2016 review of '
         'the\xa0early traits of children with autism\xa0or ADHD. For '
         'instance, clinicians and parents may rate young children with either '
         'condition as having ‘negative affect.’ But this surface state often '
         'seems to stem largely from distress, shyness, fear or sadness in '
         'children with autism, and from anger in those with ADHD. Likewise, '
         'the DSM-5 inattention criterion for ADHD—not seeming to “listen when '
         'spoken to directly”—is often also seen in children with autism; in '
         'them, however, it may derive mainly from a difficulty in processing '
         'and attending to social cues.\n'
         'In trying to determine whether autism and ADHD have common roots, '
         'researchers need to look at the motivations that impel a child’s '
         'actions and reactions, says\xa0Janne Visser, a child psychiatrist in '
         'the Netherlands who worked on the study. Studying children from '
         'infancy into adolescence, she says, will help to clarify how the '
         'features of the conditions unfold and affect the children’s '
         'development over time: One condition may lead to the other, or both '
         'may originate from a common set of risk factors, or the pathways may '
         'even converge over the course of development. “When you look at the '
         'first years of life,” she says, “you can expect to get nearer to the '
         'origins.”\n'
         'Another approach researchers are using to explore the relationship '
         'between autism and ADHD is\xa0focusing on traits, or ‘dimensions,’ '
         'rather than attempting to connect genetic or brain features with '
         'diagnoses. Looking at overarching diagnoses, some experts say, '
         'produces too much noise, given that people with the same diagnosis '
         'can differ greatly in the mix and severity of the characteristics '
         'they display. “In reality, behavior is very dimensional,” says '
         'Dawson, “and symptoms can go from very mild to severe, and you can '
         'have few symptoms or many.”\n'
         'How best to treat children who, like Naftali, have a dual diagnosis '
         'is still unclear. The effectiveness of ADHD medications can vary '
         'even in children who do not have autism. And children with autism\xa0'
         'sometimes respond less well\xa0than others or have more difficulty '
         'tolerating the drugs. “It is only through trial and error that we '
         'can make a judgment about how any particular child with ADHD will '
         'respond to any medication—including stimulants—whether or not they '
         'also have [autism],” says psychologist\xa0Deborah Pearson\xa0of the '
         'McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston.\n'
         '“I wish we knew more about what the most effective interventions are '
         'and how long we should be implementing them,” Pearson says. “What '
         'kinds of combined treatments would give us the very best outcomes?”\n'
         'Dawson is co-leading three studies to improve treatment—and early '
         'detection. She and her colleagues plan to follow about 9,000 '
         'toddlers from 18 months to 3 years, screening them for both autism '
         'and ADHD at age 3. That study aims to find early signposts of ADHD '
         'in children with autism, in part to avoid\xa0delayed diagnosis\xa0of '
         'autism in children who also have ADHD. The researchers also intend '
         'to compare patterns of brain activity, attention and behavior in '
         'children with autism alone, ADHD alone or both. And they aim to '
         'examine whether stimulant drugs improve responses to early '
         'behavioral therapy in children with autism and ADHD.\n'
         'In Naftali’s case, one of his doctors finally hit on an ADHD drug '
         'combination that helped—at least until early afternoon. “He’s going '
         'to be inattentive in the afternoon,” Wodinsky says. “We’ve all just '
         'kind of learned to live with that fact.”\n'
         'Still, Dawson says she is optimistic that outcomes for children like '
         'Naftali can be improved. “We know the brain is very plastic,” she '
         'says. “So, if we can find kids early, I am always very hopeful that, '
         'regardless of the pathways involved, we can have a positive impact '
         'on early brain development.”\n'
         'It’s a goal that resonates with Naftali’s parents.\n'
         'They have been vigilant throughout his life about making sure he '
         'gets the services and care he needs. Wodinsky credits his having a '
         'best friend to the\xa0hormone oxytocin, which he started taking as '
         'part of a clinical trial and now takes twice daily. With help from '
         'his teachers, his ADHD medication and a structured schedule at home, '
         'Naftali is doing well in a class for typical children. He is still '
         'socially immature, but like many boys his age, he spars with his '
         'sister and enjoys Minecraft and other online video games.\n'
         '“We never, ever say anything to him other than ‘You\xa0will\xa0go to '
         'college, you\xa0will\xa0get a job, you\xa0will\xa0get married.’ '
         'That’s what we plan for him,” his mother says. “There is no plan '
         'B.”\n'

 'description': 'In a new book, an argument for giving children more of a '
                'sense of control over their lives',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'The Case for the “Self-Driven Child”',
 'text': 'We are raising the anxious generation, and the conversation about '
         'the causes, and the potential cures, has just begun.\xa0 In The '
         'Self-Driven Child, authors William Stixrud and Ned Johnson focus on '
         'the ways that children today are being denied a sense of controlling '
         'their own lives—doing what they find meaningful, and succeeding, or '
         'failing, on their own. Screen time, the authors say, is part of the '
         'problem, but so are well-meaning parents and schools, who are '
         'unwittingly taking from children the opportunities they need to grow '
         'stronger, more confident, and more themselves. Stixrud and Johnson '
         'answered questions from Mind Matters editor Gareth Cook.\n'
         'What makes you think that children do not have enough control over '
         'their lives?\r\n'
         'Stixrud: We know that a low sense of control is highly associated '
         'with anxiety, depression, and virtually all mental health problems. '
         'Researchers have found that a low sense of control is one of the '
         'most stressful things that people can experience. And since the '
         '1960’s, we’ve seen a marked rise in stress-related mental health '
         'problems in children and adolescents, including anxiety, depression, '
         'and self-harm. Just in the last six or seven years, there has been '
         'an unprecedented spike in the incidence of anxiety and depression in '
         'young people.\xa0\n'
         'From a neurological perspective, when we experience a healthy sense '
         'of control, our prefrontal cortex (the executive functioning part of '
         'our brain) regulates the amygdala (a part of the brain’s threat '
         'detection system that initiates the fight or flight response). When '
         'the prefrontal cortex is in charge, we are in our right minds. We '
         'feel in control and not anxious. So, the fact that kids are feeling '
         'more anxiety, by definition, suggests that their amygdalas are more '
         'active, which indicates that they are more likely to feel '
         'overwhelmed, stuck, or helpless.\xa0\n'
         'Research on motivation has suggested that a strong sense of autonomy '
         'is the key to developing the healthy self-motivation that allows '
         'children and teens to pursue their goals with passion and to enjoy '
         'their achievements. But what we see in many of the kids we test or '
         'tutor is motivational patterns that are at the extremes of one, an '
         'obsessive drive to succeed and two, seeing little point in working '
         'hard. Many of these clients say that they feel overwhelmed by the '
         'demands placed on them, that they feel tired all the time, and that '
         'they don’t have enough downtime in their lives (related, in part, to '
         'the increasing presence of technology). Many talk about the '
         'expectations that they feel they have to live up to, and many '
         'complain about the fact that they have little “say” over their own '
         'lives.\n'
         'Is this a new problem?\r\n'
         'Stixrud: It’s one that has progressed over several decades. When '
         'psychologist Dr. Jean Twenge compared college students from the '
         '1960’s to college students in 2002, the latter reported a '
         'dramatically lower sense of control over their lives. Changes in our '
         'culture in the last 10 or 15 years appear to have contributed to an '
         'even sharper decline in a sense of control. For one, kids play much '
         'less than they did even a decade ago, as their time is taken up by '
         'more school hours, more scheduled activities, and more screen time '
         'than ever before. Researcher Peter Gray was one of the first to '
         'connect fewer opportunities to play to a decline in a sense of '
         'control. When kids could spend most of their Saturday playing, they '
         'could choose their own games and how to play them. They had a lot '
         'more autonomy and a lot more agency than kids do today. A typical '
         'Saturday now is often packed with homework and organized sports '
         'events.\xa0\n'
         'Also, for a whole host of reasons, ranging from technology to packed '
         'schedules to anxiety, kids today sleep much less than they did even '
         'a few years ago. Fifty percent of teenagers fifteen years and older '
         'now sleep less than seven hours a night, whereas adolescents on '
         'average require 9 ¼ hours of sleep not to feel tired. When we don’t '
         'get enough sleep, the connections between our prefrontal cortex and '
         'our amygdala are weakened, resulting in lower ability of the former '
         'to regulate the latter. When children are tired, they invariably '
         'experience a lowered sense of control, as they are more easily '
         'stressed, have reduced coping skills, and are more apt to experience '
         'frustration and discouragement.\n'
         'Then there’s technology, which obviously has grown ubiquitous. More '
         'kids are reliant on social media, and there may be nothing more '
         'externalizing or control-lowering than posting a photo of yourself '
         'on the internet and waiting for people to judge you. A recent '
         'article by Dr. Twenge actually suggested that the smartphone and '
         'social media have likely contributed enormously to the dramatic '
         'increase in mental health problems seen in adolescents since 2012. '
         'And studies have found that at least 10% of boys have an addictive '
         'relationship to video games. Kids who are addicted to things often '
         'tell themselves, “I know I shouldn’t be doing this but I can’t '
         'stop,” which is a pretty clear indictor that they lack a sense of '
         'control.\xa0\n'
         'We agree with Dr. Twenge that this problem has been increasing since '
         'the 1960’s because our culture has increasingly valued extrinsic and '
         'self-centered goals such as money, status, and physical '
         'attractiveness, and devalued community, affiliation, and the pursuit '
         'of meaning in life. Also, with technology driving an increasingly '
         'fast pace of life, it will only get worse unless we recognize how '
         'important having a sense of control is and make some changes.\n'
         'How do attempts at controlling a child backfire? \r\n'
         'Johnson: In addition to the physical and emotional consequences '
         '(more stress, anxiety, and depression), trying to control a child '
         'has really negative effects on motivation. According to one of the '
         'best supported theories in psychology, self-determination theory, '
         'humans have three basic needs: a sense of autonomy, a sense of '
         'competence, and a sense of relatedness. Autonomy is built into our '
         'wiring, so to speak, in the same way as hunger or thirst. When we '
         'lack this basic need, we experience decreased motivation, or the '
         'motivation we do have becomes fear-based. (“I’d better do this, or '
         'else!”) Both are terribly unhealthy. You can’t become a self-driven '
         'person if you don’t have a sense that your life is your own. We '
         'think the phenomenon of “failure to launch”—the preponderance of '
         'people in their twenties and thirties living at home—is in part '
         'attributable to the idea that young adults don’t have the same drive '
         'for independence they used to have. They want to sit at home and '
         'play on their phones. They don’t want to drive as much, date as '
         'much, have sex as much. They are accustomed to someone else being in '
         'charge of their life, and their internal motivation system is '
         'stymied.\n'
         'There’s another way to look at it, too. Evaluate what you gain when '
         'you try to control a child. Let’s say you think your son—who '
         'struggles in math—should see a tutor all summer, and he disagrees. '
         'But you insist. It’s possible that tutoring would help some, but the '
         'truth is that kids benefit very little from academic help they '
         'resist and don’t feel they want or need. Even if it does help him, '
         'it comes at a great cost. It causes strain in your relationship with '
         'him. His competency might be improved, but his relatedness (his '
         'relationship with you) and his autonomy are lowered.\xa0 Think of a '
         'three-legged stool where you make one leg longer and the other two '
         'shorter.\xa0 You cannot reach higher on that stool.\xa0 The most '
         'likely outcome is that it will tip over.\xa0 And, you have signaled '
         'to him that you know better than he does, that his opinion doesn’t '
         'matter. He also misses out on seeing what it’s like to make '
         'decisions for himself. Kids need experience checking in with '
         'themselves and their decisions, and they can’t do that if you’re '
         'making each one.\n'
         'Can you please explain the idea of home as a “safe base”? \r\n'
         'Johnson: Just as in baseball, when you reach home base, you’re in a '
         'place where you can catch your breath and not have to worry about '
         'being pegged with the ball or being called out, home should be a '
         'place for kids to rest and recover. They are facing stressors each '
         'day, from school demands to social dynamics. You want home to be the '
         'place they can go to seek a respite from it all, where they feel '
         'safe and loved unconditionally, where they can fully relax, so that '
         'they can gather the energy to go back out. But if home is a '
         'stressful environment—if parents are an anxious or controlling '
         'presence—kids will seek that respite somewhere—or somehow—else. And '
         'most of the time, it’s a place you don’t want them to go. Or, if '
         'nowhere can be that safe base, they are really in trouble, as being '
         'chronically stressed is about the worst thing imaginable for brains, '
         'especially developing ones. That’s why we tell parents that one of '
         'the most important things they can say to their kids is, “I love you '
         'too much to fight with you about your homework,” and why we want '
         'them to move in the direction of being a non-anxious presence for '
         'their kids.\n'
         'What else can we do to give children more of a sense of self '
         'control? \r\n'
         'Johnson: We can give kids opportunities to learn to handle as much '
         'as they can, without being overwhelmed. Children thrive and grow '
         'when they feel challenged but not threatened. Personal pastimes '
         '(especially when kids can turn up or down the pace or intensity '
         'themselves) are great for this. Think of how video games work: the '
         'better you can play and the further you advance, the harder the game '
         'gets. You don’t actually die; you just have to try again. It’s '
         'fantastic! Games can be incredibly frustrating but almost no one '
         'wants a “cheat code” to get ahead. It just doesn’t offer the same '
         'satisfaction. In life, kids want to feel that their successes were '
         'earned. Give your kid every opportunity to stretch himself through '
         'music, sports, coding, after school jobs, hiking, martial arts, '
         'whatever inspires his passion. That sense of mastery and autonomy in '
         'an activity he loves can cascade into other facets of his life.\xa0\n'
         'You can nurture habits and a lifestyle that support healthy minds: '
         'Above all, promote rest. Encourage sleep, meditation if they’re '
         'interested, and downtime. Many of the students I see complain that '
         'the moment they have a free hour, their parent rushes in to fill it. '
         'Rest is not laziness. It is the basis of all activity. Foster what '
         'we call Radical Digital Downtime. No phones. No screens. Those times '
         'of mind-wandering (some call it boredom) activate neural circuits in '
         'the Default Mode Network, a system that involves reflecting on the '
         'past and projecting into the future, processing life. Radical '
         'downtime increases the control that the prefrontal cortex exerts '
         'over the amygdala, keeping you in your “right mind.”\n'
         'Lastly, make it your highest priority to simply enjoy your kids. As '
         'they are. Right now. Flaws and all.\xa0 For the development of '
         'babies, one of the most important inputs is parents who are warm and '
         'responsive.\xa0 When do you think kids outgrow that need? We think, '
         'never.\n',

         'exactly the opposite: that murders, crimes and mass shootings happen '
         "because there aren't enough guns in enough places. Arming more "
         'people will make our country safer and more peaceful, they say, '
         "because criminals won't cause trouble if they know they are "
         'surrounded by gun-toting good guys.\n'
         'After all, since 1991 Americans have acquired 170 million new guns '
         'while murder rates have plummeted, according to the National Rifle '
         'Association of America (NRA). Donald Trump, when running for '
         'president, said of the 2015 shooting massacre in San Bernardino, '
         'Calif., that “if we had guns in California on the other side, where '
         "the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or "
         '15 people dead right now.” Mike Watkins, a cop–turned–firearm '
         "instructor at the Kennesaw range, put it this way: “If I'm a bad "
         "guy, and I know this place has guns, it's not a place I'm obviously "
         'going to want to go and do something bad.”\n'
         'Is there truth to this claim? An ideal experiment would be an '
         'interventional study in which scientists would track what happened '
         'for several years after guns were given to gun-free communities and '
         'everything else was kept the same. But alas, there are no gun-free '
         'U.S. communities, and the ethics of doing such a study are dubious. '
         'So instead scientists compare what happens to gun-toting people, in '
         'gun-dense regions, with what happens to people and places with few '
         'firearms. They also study whether crime victims are more or less '
         'likely to own guns than others, and they track what transpires when '
         'laws make it easier for people to carry guns or use them for '
         'self-defense.\n'
         'Most of this research—and there have been several dozen '
         'peer-reviewed studies—punctures the idea that guns stop violence. In '
         'a 2015 study using data from the FBI and the Centers for Disease '
         'Control and Prevention, for example, researchers at Boston '
         "Children's Hospital and Harvard University reported that firearm "
         'assaults were 6.8 times more common in the states with the most guns '
         'versus those with the least. Also in 2015 a combined analysis of 15 '
         'different studies found that people who had access to firearms at '
         'home were nearly twice as likely to be murdered as people who did '
         'not.\n'
         'This evidence has been slow to accumulate because of restrictions '
         "placed by Congress on one of the country's biggest injury research "
         'funders, the CDC. Since the mid-1990s the agency has been '
         'effectively blocked from supporting gun violence research. And the '
         'NRA and many gun owners have emphasized a small handful of studies '
         'that point the other way.\n'
         'I grew up in Georgia, so I decided to travel around that state and '
         'in Alabama, where the belief that guns save good people is sewn into '
         'the fabric of everyday life. I wanted to get a read on the science '
         'and listen to people with relevant experience: cops, elected '
         'officials, gun owners, injury researchers and firearm experts such '
         "as Watkins, who stood by my side as I pulled the Glock's trigger.\n"
         'For clues on how guns affect violence, Kennesaw is an obvious place '
         'to start. On March 15, 1982, this city 24 miles north of Atlanta '
         'passed a controversial law: to “provide for and protect the safety, '
         'security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants,” '
         'Kennesaw would require that every head of a household own a firearm '
         'and ammunition.\n'
         'Nearly 35 years to the day after the law passed, I drove down '
         'Cherokee Street in Kennesaw until I reached the Bobby Grant Center '
         'police annex, a small brick building perched in front of a large '
         "water tower. The annex houses the city's detectives; the main police "
         'department is a quarter of a mile down the street. I picked up the '
         'entry phone next to the locked door and buzzed. One second later a '
         'big man with a moustache and goatee, who was clearly waiting for me, '
         'let me in. He introduced himself as Lieutenant Craig Graydon, the '
         'man I was there to meet.\n'
         "Graydon heads up Kennesaw's Criminal Investigations Division and "
         "keeps track of all the city's crime statistics. He led me back to "
         'his dark office, where a computer glowed with a screen saver of the '
         'cast of the old Untouchables TV show, starring Robert Stack as '
         "federal agent Eliot Ness. Graydon's great-grandfather and father "
         "were both in law enforcement. “I've been around weapons of all kinds "
         'for as long as I can remember,” he said.\n'
         'Kennesaw is proud of its gun law. “Inmates have been picked up on '
         "other charges around the area, and they've said, ‘No, I would never "
         'break in a house in Kennesaw,’” Graydon said. City officials tout '
         'that a year after the law was implemented, burglaries in Kennesaw '
         'dropped by more than half; by 1985 they were down by 80 percent. “It '
         'was a selling point for the town,” according to David McDowall, a '
         'criminologist at the University at Albany, S.U.N.Y. The lavish media '
         "attention that the law received probably helps: it's not just that "
         "Kennesaw residents have guns; it's that everyone knows Kennesaw "
         'residents have guns. (That said, the rule has never been enforced, '
         "and Graydon estimates that only about half of Kennesaw's residents "
         'actually own firearms.)\n'
         'But while burglary numbers did drastically decline in Kennesaw after '
         '1981, those statistics can be misleading. McDowall took a closer '
         'look at the numbers and noticed that 1981 was an anomaly—there were '
         '75 percent more burglaries that year than there were, on average, in '
         'the previous five years. It is no surprise that the subsequent years '
         'looked great by comparison. McDowall studied before-and-after '
         'burglary numbers using 1978, 1979 or 1980 as starting points instead '
         'of 1981 and, as he reported in a 1989 paper, the purported crime '
         'drop disappeared. Kennesaw has always had pretty minimal crime, '
         'which may have more to do with the residents and location than how '
         'many guns it has.\n'
         'Yet the sense I got in Kennesaw—which feels like a typical small '
         "city, not some gun-frenzied town—is that data don't matter to a lot "
         'of people. It was similar in other places I visited. What matters '
         'more is apparent logic: guns stop criminals, so they keep people '
         'safer. The night before I met Graydon, I attended a lecture by a '
         'Second Amendment lawyer in Stone Mountain, Ga., 30 miles southeast '
         'of Kennesaw. At one point, the lawyer mentioned Samuel Colt, who '
         "popularized the revolver in the mid-19th century. “I haven't seen "
         "the statistics, but I've got to assume that the instances of rape "
         'and strong-arm robberies plummeted when those became widespread,” he '
         'said. Numbers and statistics, in other words, were almost '
         'unnecessary—everyone just knows that where there are more guns, '
         'there is less crime.\n'
         'So what does the research say? By far the most famous series of '
         'studies on this issue was conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s by '
         'Arthur Kellermann, now dean of the F. Edward Hébert School of '
         'Medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health '
         'Sciences, and his colleagues. In one, published in 1993 in the New '
         'England Journal of Medicine and funded by the CDC, he and his '
         'colleagues identified 444 people who had been killed between 1987 '
         'and 1992 at home in three U.S. regions—Shelby County, Tennessee, '
         'King County, Washington State, and Cuyahoga County, Ohio—and then '
         'collected details about them and their deaths from local police, '
         'medical examiners and people who had been close to the victims. They '
         'found that a gun in the home was associated with a nearly threefold '
         'increase in the odds that someone would be killed at home by a '
         'family member or intimate acquaintance.\n'
         'These findings directly contradict the rationale I kept hearing in '
         'Georgia, and that could be because human behavior is a lot messier '
         'than simple logic predicts. Researchers posit that even if keeping a '
         'gun at home does thwart the odd break-in, it may also change the gun '
         "owner's behavior in ways that put that person and his or her family "
         'more at risk. “The fact that you have a gun may mean that you do '
         "things you shouldn't be doing: you take chances you shouldn't "
         "otherwise take; you go to places where it's really not safe, but you "
         'feel safe,” says David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury '
         'Control Research Center. This added risk may overpower any '
         'protective effects.\n'
         "There's also the fact that where there are more guns, more "
         'opportunities exist for people to steal them and use them '
         "nefariously. Indeed, one of Kennesaw's crime problems, Graydon told "
         'me, is gun theft, so the Kennesaw Police Department encourages '
         'residents to lock their guns up. The NRA, on the other hand, opposes '
         'legislation that requires secure gun storage.\n'
         'The initial work by Kellermann and his colleagues was criticized for '
         'not using enough statistical controls. So they went on to publish '
         'other studies confirming the link between guns and more violence. In '
         'one, they found that a gun in the home was tied to a nearly fivefold '
         'increase in the odds of suicide. (More Americans die from gun '
         'suicides every year than gun homicides.) In another, published in '
         '1998, they reported that guns at home were four times more likely to '
         'cause an accidental shooting, seven times more likely to be used in '
         'assault or homicide, and 11 times more likely to be used in a '
         'suicide than they were to be used for self-defense.\n'
         'The research made headlines in the New York Times and the Washington '
         'Post. It also infuriated the gun lobby, which launched a war against '
         'gun research that persists today.\n'
         'One veteran of that war is injury researcher Mark Rosenberg. I drove '
         "to Rosenberg's Atlanta-area home—only 15 miles from where I lived as "
         'a child—after leaving the Kennesaw Police Department, and we sat '
         'down in his living room. In the late 1990s Rosenberg was the '
         "director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and "
         'Control, which then funded and studied gun violence. He said he was '
         'fired from the agency in 1999 for pushing ahead with this research '
         'despite political opposition, although his boss at the time, whom I '
         "contacted, disagreed that Rosenberg's actions on gun research caused "
         'his dismissal.\n'
         'I asked Rosenberg what happened after the Kellermann studies came '
         'out. “The NRA started a multipronged attack on us,” he recounted. '
         '“They called the CDC a cesspool of junk science.” Indeed, soon after '
         "Kellermann's early studies were published, the NRA ran an article in "
         'its official journal, the American Rifleman, encouraging readers to '
         "protest the CDC's use of tax dollars to “conduct anti-gun "
         'pseudo-scientific studies disguised as research.” The association '
         "also asked the National Institute of Health's Office of Scientific "
         'Integrity to investigate Kellermann and his colleagues, but it '
         'declined. Todd Adkins, current director of research and information '
         "at the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, told me via e-mail "
         'that the association was reacting because CDC scientists had started '
         'a campaign to persuade Americans that firearms are a menace to '
         'public health and ignored data that did not support this idea.\n'
         'As the dispute continued, Representative Jay Dickey of Arkansas '
         "introduced a rider into the CDC's 1996 spending bill mandating that "
         'none of its funding be used to advocate or promote gun control. '
         "Congress also cut out $2.6 million of the CDC's budget, the exact "
         'amount that had been allocated for firearm research the previous '
         'year. (Later, that funding was restored but was earmarked for '
         "traumatic brain injury.) Harvard's Hemenway says that the move “was "
         "a shot across the bow: ‘We're watching you.’” He adds that “the CDC "
         'recognized that they better be really, really, really, really '
         'careful about guns if they wanted to have an Injury Center.”\n'
         "Dickey's addition to the CDC's funding bill has been renewed every "
         'year since. In fact, in 2011 the language was extended to cover all '
         'Department of Health and Human Services agencies, including the NIH. '
         'But Dickey later said that he did not intend to put a stop to all '
         "gun research—and he wished that he hadn't. He died this past April.\n"
         "The CDC's hands are still tied. After the 2012 school shooting that "
         'took the lives of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Conn., '
         'President Barack Obama signed an executive order requesting that the '
         'CDC spend $10 million on gun violence research. But Congress did not '
         'appropriate the funds. In fact, according to Linda DeGutis, who '
         "directed the CDC's Injury Center from 2010 to 2014, agency employees "
         "weren't even allowed to discuss Newtown. “We couldn't talk to the "
         "media except on background. We couldn't be quoted on anything,” she "
         "recalls. “There were CDC staff members who wouldn't even mention the "
         'word ‘gun.’” (Current staffers declined to be interviewed for this '
         'article.)\n'
         'Garen Wintemute, a physician and noted gun violence researcher at '
         'the University of California, Davis, is not terribly surprised that '
         "everything went down the way it did. “It's like doing work in any "
         'other controversial field that threatens established interests. '
         'Those interests respond in a way to minimize the threat,” he says. '
         'Rosenberg, after leaving the CDC, became CEO of a nonprofit that '
         'works to improve health in developing countries (he retired from '
         'that role last year). But Wintemute and others have continued with '
         'gun research, procuring grants from private foundations and '
         'government agencies such as the National Institute of Justice. In '
         '2005 Wintemute started using his own private money to fund his '
         'research and has spent about $1.7 million so far.\n'
         'More than 30 peer-reviewed studies, focusing on individuals as well '
         "as populations, have been published that confirm what Kellermann's "
         'studies suggested: that guns are associated with an increased risk '
         'for violence and homicide. “There is really uniform data to support '
         'the statement that access to firearms is associated with an '
         'increased risk of firearm-related death and injury,” Wintemute '
         'concludes. Gun advocates argue the causes are reversed: surges in '
         'violent crime lead people to buy guns, and weapons do not create the '
         'surge. But if that were true, gun purchases would increase in tandem '
         'with all kinds of violence. In reality, they do not.\n'
         'When I asked people I met on my trip to Georgia for their thoughts '
         "on how guns influence violence, many said they couldn't believe that "
         "guns were a root cause. “It's easier to go after the object than it "
         'is to go after the motive,” Graydon told me. He does have a point: A '
         'growing body of research suggests that violence is a contagious '
         'behavior that exists independent of weapon or means. In this '
         'framework, guns are accessories to infectious violence rather than '
         "fountainheads. But this does not mean guns don't matter. Guns "
         'intensify violent encounters, upping the stakes and worsening the '
         'outcomes—which explains why there are more deaths and '
         'life-threatening injuries where firearms are common. Violence may be '
         'primarily triggered by other violence, but these deadly weapons make '
         'all this violence worse.\n'
         'My next stop, Scottsboro, Alabama, is within a county where nearly '
         'one in every five people has a permit to carry a concealed weapon. '
         'Overall in Alabama, an estimated 12 percent of residents have '
         'permission to carry concealed firearms, possibly the highest such '
         'rate in the country. Jackson County, home to Scottsboro, ranks close '
         'to the top of the state with that nearly one-in-five figure. I '
         'wanted to know if people in this sleepy town just north of the '
         'Tennessee River commonly used these hidden guns to thwart crime.\n'
         "I left Rosenberg's home and drove 120 miles northwest. I drove past "
         'an Econo Lodge, a No. 1 China Buffet and a CashMart and then parked '
         'at the Jackson County courthouse, an impressive Neoclassical brick '
         'building with a clock tower. Scottsboro gained notoriety in 1931, '
         'when eight black youths were sentenced to death in its courthouse by '
         'an all-white jury after being falsely accused of raping two white '
         'women, a decision that was appealed up to the U.S. Supreme Court. '
         'After passing through the metal detectors, I meandered around in '
         "search of the sheriff's office, which I eventually found at the back "
         'of the ground floor. A receptionist walked me in to meet Sheriff '
         'Chuck Phillips, who was sitting at his desk with his chief deputy, '
         'Rocky Harnen. A sheet entitled “Handgun Fundamentals” hung on the '
         'wall behind the desk.\n'
         '“I promise you, everybody here that wants a gun has got one or 100,” '
         'Phillips told me, drawling out the number so it sounded like '
         '“hunnerd.” I asked how many times Scottsboro residents had used '
         "their guns to protect themselves. “I've been doing this for 35 "
         "years, and I just can't recall one,” the sheriff answered. Harnen, "
         'though, suddenly remembered something. “We did have a lady that was '
         'in one of our firearms classes. She had a guy try to break into her '
         "house,” he recalled. “She yelled and said, ‘I've got a gun,’ and she "
         'opened the door, and he was running away—she fired at him.”\n'
         'But they could not think of any other examples. Graydon, back in '
         'Kennesaw, also could not remember a time when a resident used a gun '
         'in self-defense, and he has been working for the police department '
         'for 31 years.\n'
         'The frequency of self-defense gun use rests at the heart of the '
         'controversy over how guns affect our country. Progun enthusiasts '
         'argue that it happens all the time. In 1995 Gary Kleck, a '
         'criminologist at Florida State University, and his colleague Marc '
         'Gertz published a study that elicited what has become one of the gun '
         "lobby's favorite numbers. They randomly surveyed 5,000 Americans and "
         'asked if they, or another member of the household, had used a gun '
         'for self-protection in the past year. A little more than 1 percent '
         'of the participants answered yes, and when Kleck and Gertz '
         'extrapolated their results, they concluded that Americans use guns '
         'for self-defense as many as 2.5 million times a year.\n'
         'This estimate is, however, vastly higher than numbers from '
         'government surveys, such as the National Crime Victimization Survey '
         '(NCVS), which is conducted in tens of thousands of households. It '
         'suggests that victims use guns for self-defense only 65,000 times a '
         "year. In 2015 Hemenway and his colleagues studied five years' worth "
         'of NCVS data and concluded that guns are used for self-defense in '
         'less than 1 percent of all crimes that occur in the presence of a '
         'victim. They also found that self-defense gun use is about as '
         'effective as other defensive maneuvers, such as calling for help. '
         "“It's not as if you look at the data, and it says people who defend "
         'themselves with a gun are much less likely to be injured,” says '
         'Philip Cook, an economist at Duke University, who has been studying '
         'guns since the 1970s.\n'
         "Kleck and Getz's survey and the NCVS differ in important ways that "
         'could help explain the discrepancy between them. The NCVS first '
         'establishes that someone has been the victim of an attack before '
         'asking about self-defense gun use, which weeds out yes answers from '
         'people who might, say, wave their gun around during a bar fight and '
         "call it self-defense. Kleck and Getz's survey could overestimate "
         'self-defense use by including such ambiguous uses. Kleck counters '
         'that the NCVS might underestimate self-defense because people who do '
         'not trust government surveyors will be afraid to admit that they '
         'used their gun. Yet people who participate in the NCVS are told at '
         'the start that they are protected under federal law and that their '
         'responses will remain anonymous.\n'
         'A closer look at the who, what, where and why of gun violence also '
         'sheds some light on the self-defense claim. Most Americans with '
         'concealed carry permits are white men living in rural areas, yet it '
         'is young black men in urban areas who disproportionately encounter '
         'violence. Violent crimes are also geographically concentrated: '
         "Between 1980 and 2008, half of all of Boston's gun violence occurred "
         "on only 3 percent of the city's streets and intersections. And in "
         'Seattle, over a 14-year-period, every single juvenile crime incident '
         'took place on less than 5 percent of street segments. In other '
         'words, most people carrying guns have only a small chance of '
         'encountering situations in which they could use them for '
         'self-defense.\n'
         "Yet these numbers don't resonate with many gun owners. “Absolutely, "
         'owning a firearm makes you safer,” Phillips told me. Watkins opined '
         'that “by having a gun, it gives you the opportunity to refuse to be '
         'a victim.” (Watkins, who used to be a cop in upstate New York, did '
         'later concede that guns are rarely shot in self-defense, even by law '
         'enforcement.) In a June 2017 study, researchers surveyed American '
         'gun owners about why they owned handguns, reporting that 88 percent '
         'bought them for self-defense; many felt they were likely to become '
         'targets of violent crime at some point. This belief is so pervasive '
         'that companies have even started selling self-defense insurance. At '
         'the lecture I attended in Stone Mountain, a representative of Texas '
         'Law Shield, a firearms legal defense program, tried to get me to '
         'sign up for a service that would provide free legal representation '
         "in the event that I ever shot someone to protect myself. “You don't "
         'need it till you need it, but when you need it, you daggone sure '
         'glad you got it,” he said.\n'
         'But even as the belief that we are all future crime targets has '
         'taken hold, violent crime rates have actually dropped in the U.S. in '
         'recent decades. According to the FBI, rates were a whopping 41 '
         'percent lower in 2015 than they were in 1996. The NRA attributes '
         'this decrease to the acquisition of more guns. But that is '
         'misleading. What has increased is the number of people who own '
         'multiple guns—the actual number of people and households who own '
         'them has substantially dropped.\n'
         'Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense '
         'gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety '
         'after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in '
         'Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense '
         'when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they '
         'should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no '
         'reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that '
         'when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide '
         'rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states '
         'that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 '
         'percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark '
         'Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas '
         'A&M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to '
         'kill people resulted in more dead people.”\n'
         'But some argue that even an unused gun can thwart crime. The logic '
         'here is that in areas with high rates of concealed carrying, '
         "criminals don't want to victimize people who might have guns, so "
         "they don't commit violent crimes. The most famous study, published "
         'in 1997 by John R. Lott, Jr., then a research fellow at the '
         'University of Chicago, and David B. Mustard, an economist now at the '
         'University of Georgia, looked at county crime rates in several '
         'states that had passed laws making it easy to get gun permits at '
         'various times prior to 1992. They compared such rates to crime '
         'levels in places that did not have easy access to guns during that '
         'period. Their hypothesis: when areas make it easier for people to '
         'get permits, more people will get guns and start carrying—and then '
         'violence will drop. Lott and Mustard developed a model, based on '
         'this comparison, that indicated that when it was easier to get '
         'permits, assaults fell by 5 percent, rapes by 7 percent and murders '
         'by 7.65 percent. Lott went on to publish a book in 1998 called More '
         'Guns, Less Crime, which tracked concealed carry laws and crime in '
         'more than 3,000 counties and reported similar findings.\n'
         'Many other researchers have come to opposite conclusions. John '
         'Donohue, an economist at Stanford University, reported in a working '
         'paper in June 2017 that when states ease permit requirements, most '
         'violent crime rates increase and keep getting worse. A decade after '
         'laws relax, violent crime rates are 13 to 15 percent higher than '
         'they were before. And in 2004 the National Research Council, which '
         'provides independent advice on scientific issues, turned its '
         "attention to firearm research, including Lott's findings. It asked "
         "15 scholars to reanalyze Lott's data because “there was such a "
         'conflict in the field about the findings,” recalls panel chair and '
         'criminologist Charles Wellford, now a professor emeritus at the '
         "University of Maryland. Lott's models, they found, could be tweaked "
         'in tiny ways to produce big changes in results. “The analyses that '
         'we did, and that others have done, show that these estimates are '
         'very fragile,” Wellford explains. “The committee, with one '
         'exception, concluded that you could not accept his conclusion that '
         'more guns meant less crime.” Wintemute summarized it this way: '
         '“There are a few studies that suggest that liberalizing access to '
         'concealed firearms has, on balance, beneficial effects. There are a '
         'far larger number of studies that suggest that it has, on balance, '
         'detrimental effects.”\n'
         'Lott, who now runs the nonprofit Crime Prevention Research Center, '
         'says the panel was biased and “set up to try to go against my work.” '
         'The NRA takes a related tack: it says research highlighting the '
         'danger of weapons is part of a gun-control agenda to confiscate '
         'firearms.\n'
         'It is crucial, though, to distinguish the leadership of progun '
         'organizations from their constituents, who often have more nuanced '
         "opinions. “I do own a firearm, I'm licensed, I'm actually able to "
         'train others in using a firearm—and my goal in life is to never, '
         'ever, ever have to use it,” says Tina Monaghan, a city clerk in '
         'Nelson, Ga. (In 2013 Nelson, like Kennesaw, passed a law mandating '
         'that residents own guns, but the ordinance was relaxed later that '
         'year in response to a lawsuit.) According to a 2015 survey published '
         'by Johns Hopkins University researchers, 85 percent of gun owners '
         'support background checks for all gun sales, including sales through '
         'unlicensed dealers—even though the NRA strongly opposes them.\n'
         'I heard a lot more about divergence from NRA positions on my last '
         'stop in Alabama: Scottsboro Gun and Pawn, a shop perched at the end '
         "of Broad Street, one of the town's main drags. The co-owner, Robert "
         'Shook, told me about the ongoing push in the Alabama State Senate to '
         'eliminate concealed carry permits altogether, a move that would make '
         'it legal for anyone older than 18 to carry a hidden gun. (The bill '
         'passed in the Alabama Senate in April of this year but did not come '
         "up for a vote in the state's House of Representatives during the "
         "2017 session.) “There's a lot of stuff that the NRA does that I "
         "don't agree with,” he said, standing behind a glass case filled with "
         "handguns. “They've gone farther right than the other side left. "
         "They're throwing common sense out the window.” Indeed, the NRA of "
         'today is actually more extreme than the organization used to be. In '
         'the 1930s NRA president Karl Frederick testified in Congress in '
         'support of the National Firearms Act, which restricted concealed '
         'carrying. “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of '
         'guns,” Frederick said.\n'
         'The belief that more guns lead to fewer crimes is founded on the '
         'idea that guns are dangerous when bad guys have them, so we should '
         'get more guns into the hands of good guys. Yet Cook, the Duke '
         'economist, says this good guy/bad guy dichotomy is a false and '
         'dangerous one. Even upstanding American citizens are only human—they '
         'can “lose their temper, or exercise poor judgment, or misinterpret a '
         "situation, or have a few drinks,” he explains, and if they're "
         'carrying guns when they do, bad things can ensue. In 2013 in Ionia, '
         'Mich., a road rage incident led two drivers—both concealed carry '
         'permit holders—to get out of their cars, take out their guns and '
         'kill each other.\n'
         'As I drove from Scottsboro to Atlanta to catch my flight home, I '
         'kept turning over what I had seen and learned. Although we do not '
         'yet know exactly how guns affect us, the notion that more guns lead '
         'to less crime is almost certainly incorrect. The research on guns is '
         'not uniform, and we could certainly use more of it. But when all but '
         'a few studies point in the same direction, we can feel confident '
         'that the arrow is aiming at the truth—which is, in this case, that '
         'guns do not inhibit crime and violence but instead make it worse.\n'
         "The popular gun-advocacy bumper sticker says that “guns don't kill "
         'people, people kill people”—and it is, in fact, true. People, all of '
         'us, lead complicated lives, misinterpret situations, get angry, make '
         'mistakes. And when a mistake involves pulling a trigger, the damage '
         "can't be undone. Unlike my Glock-aided attack on the zombie at the "
         'gun range, life is not target practice.\n',

 'description': 'In Steven Pinker’s new book, ',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'The Secret behind One of the Greatest Success Stories in All of '
         'History',
 'text': 'In thinking about the state of the world, it is easy to see the '
         'signs of backsliding, and to feel at least a little despair. And '
         'this, argues Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker, is a '
         'profound error. In Enlightenment Now, he makes a powerful case that '
         'the main line of history has been, since the Enlightenment, one of '
         'improvement. We, the people of Earth, are better off now than we '
         'have ever been. And to fail to understand this—and the reasons '
         'why—is to put that very progress at risk. Pinker answered question '
         'from Mind Matters editor Gareth Cook.\n'
         'If things are getting better, why does it feel like they are getting '
         'worse? \r\n'
         'Improvements are gradual and not much to look at—children who don’t '
         'die and go to school, countries which are at peace, editorialists '
         'who aren’t jailed, women who can walk the streets in safety. '
         'Setbacks are sudden and photogenic— explosions, rampage shootings, '
         'refugees, tornados. Our sense of risk, cognitive scientists have '
         'shown, is driven by available images, not data. Also, there’s a '
         'market for gloom. Prophets, pundits, social critics, dystopian '
         'filmmakers and tabloid psychics know they can achieve instant '
         'gravitas by warning of doomsday. Those who point out that the world '
         'is getting better, even if they’re just reporting the data, may be '
         'dismissed as Polyannas and Panglosses.\n'
         'We seem to be living in a time of political crisis, driven by '
         'polarization and rising economic inequality. Doesn’t this threaten '
         'the trends you discuss, and what gives you hope that the crisis will '
         'resolve? \r\n'
         'There is never a time at which pundits don’t say we’re in crisis. '
         'It’s an easy formula: just list all the worst problems taking place '
         'anywhere in the world, and things will look more dire than they ever '
         'have. But past decades had much worse poverty at home and in the '
         'developing world, more and deadlier wars, nuclear escalations, a '
         'homicide rate twice as high as what we have now, homosexuality '
         'illegal in many states, and much else. It’s simply a mathematical '
         'fallacy to point to things going wrong now and to say life is '
         'getting worse: you have to compare it to life in the past.\n'
         'That having been said, there’s no question that the administration '
         'of Donald Trump is pushing back against the forces of progress. And '
         'Enlightenment Now is not a statement of “hope”—it’s a documentation '
         'of how far we’ve come and what we have to lose. The common question '
         'is a sign of how people cannot understand progress: they confuse '
         'historical facts with a sunny disposition.\n'
         'The enlightenment idea of progress rests on the assumption that the '
         'stronger ideas—the ones best supported by the data—win out. Yet '
         'technology has delivered powerful ways of controlling people’s '
         'attention, and undercutting their trust in institutions, like '
         'journalism, that present the truth. Doesn’t this concern you? \r\n'
         'Actually, the Enlightenment idea of progress is not a crystal ball '
         'or a reading of chicken entrails with a prognostication of what will '
         'inevitably happen in the future. It’s the conviction that that if we '
         'apply knowledge to increase human flourishing, then progress may '
         'happen. (If we don’t, it won’t.) Regarding technology’s supposed '
         'control of attention: social media, the panic du jour, gets blamed '
         'for everything that seems to be going wrong in the world. But the '
         'chronology is wrong: trust in institutions has been declining since '
         'its high point in the 1960s, and the trend toward political '
         'polarization predated Facebook and is driven far more by educational '
         'and occupational segregation.\n'
         'As to “whether it concerns me”—once again, the question '
         'misunderstands the nature of progress and the point of Enlightenment '
         'Now. It’s not that we shouldn’t be “concerned” about new problems, '
         'as if human improvement were driven by a guardian angel or a fairy '
         'godmother. It’s precisely because people are concerned that progress '
         'can happen.\n'
         'Having looked at the long arc of history, what gives you the most '
         'hope? \r\n'
         'Rationality has a permanent advantage: it continues to be valid '
         'regardless of whether people believe in it. Also, as people from '
         'diverse backgrounds find themselves in the same boat, their values '
         'tend to go in the direction of universal flourishing, since it '
         'depends on nothing more—but nothing less—than their common '
         'humanity.\xa0\n',

                'list of bizarre theories',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': '“Sonic Weapon Attacks” on U.S. Embassy Don’t Add Up—for Anyone',
 'text': 'HAVANA—Heated charges have flown back and forth for months between '
         'the two countries that bracket the Strait of Florida. U.S. State '
         'Department officials contended Cuba staged a sonic attack on '
         'employees of the American embassy, causing a variety of neurological '
         'symptoms. Cuba has not only denied such an attack ever took place '
         'but has also emphasized the physical impossibility of a sound wave '
         'causing neurological damage trained on such a distant target.\n'
         'But physicians and scientists from both countries now appear to be '
         'in agreement on one critical point: Both sides acknowledge they are '
         'baffled as to what happened to 24\xa0embassy employees who were '
         'diagnosed with mild traumatic brain damage between November 2016 and '
         'August 2017.\n'
         'The latest development is a preliminary publication in JAMA The '
         'Journal of the American Medical Association on Thursday, authored by '
         'the team of doctors at the University of Pennsylvania who examined '
         '21 of the U.S. government employees. The study, commissioned by the '
         'federal government, found the patients had suffered from '
         'concussionlike symptoms—but without any blunt trauma to the head. '
         'The medical issues varied widely among the patients, and included '
         'cognitive difficulties and problems with balance, eye tracking, '
         'sleep disturbances and headache.\n'
         'Adding yet another element to the mystery, the new findings show '
         'normal MRI brain scans in all patients, and normal hearing in all '
         'but three individuals. The authors of the JAMA study also discount '
         'the likelihood of sonic injury, infection or toxic agents—and they '
         'even downplay the frequent suggestion of mass hysteria. Many of the '
         'findings in the new report echo a previous investigation carried out '
         'by Cuban officials.\n'
         'The new report’s inconclusiveness does little to break the impasse. '
         'The State Department has issued multiple warnings in recent months '
         'that U.S. citizens should not travel to Cuba, because numerous '
         'embassy employees here had been targeted in attacks. The culprit was '
         'thought to be some form of unidentified sonic weapon trained on '
         'embassy employees, primarily in their residences near the post, '
         'including at the Capri Hotel.\n'
         'The precise mechanism of the alleged attacks remains unclear. '
         'Between November 2016 and August 2017, some embassy staff complained '
         'of hearing strange sounds that targeted specific individuals—one '
         'person would hear them and another in the same room wouldn’t. By '
         'August 2017, physicians at the University of Miami and Penn had '
         'diagnosed 24 of 80 embassy employees with mild traumatic brain '
         'injury, likely caused by “trauma due to a non-natural source.” This '
         'report led to an angry response from U.S. lawmakers, including Sen. '
         'Bob Menendez (D–N.J.), who described the incidents as “brazen and '
         'vicious attacks” on diplomats.\n'
         'Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.), who chaired a January 9 U.S. Senate '
         'Foreign Relations Subcommittee hearing on the attacks, described the '
         'supposed sonic weapon as “very sophisticated technology that does '
         'not exist in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world.” Without '
         'knowing more about the causes of the incidents, Todd Brown, '
         'now–acting assistant director for international programs at the '
         'State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, testified he could '
         'not assure the safety of diplomats coming to Cuba.\n'
         '\xa0\n'
         'Throughout the series of alleged attacks, however, questions have '
         'persisted as to how any sonic weapon could, without deafening levels '
         'of noise, have produced hearing loss and cognitive symptoms. In an '
         'attempt to address these questions, the Cuban government formed a '
         'technical committee of officials and academics to investigate the '
         'incidents; a report was issued late last year. At the Cuban '
         'Neurosciences Center, a towering concrete building situated near '
         'President Raul Castro’s heavily guarded estate well outside the '
         'tourist area, Mitchell Valdés-Sosa, general director of the center '
         'and an expert in auditory physiology who served on the technical '
         'committee, reviewed the report with me in late December.\n'
         'The authors—a team of scientists including neuroscientists, '
         'physicians and physicists, among others—examined the available '
         'medical reports on afflicted embassy employees. The scientists and '
         'criminal investigators set up sound and radio-electronic spectrum '
         'surveillance devices at the U.S. embassy, the Capri Hotel and in '
         'residential areas where the diplomats lived.\n'
         'During the investigation, the team gathered witness statements from '
         'embassy employees and residents, and performed medical exams and '
         'hearing tests on 20 people interviewed in the area surrounding the '
         'embassy. They analyzed hospital records in Havana for admissions of '
         'patients with medical complaints similar to those reported by '
         'embassy employees and for incidents of possible infections known to '
         'damage hearing. They also performed experimental tests and '
         'mathematical modeling of sound propagation and attenuation through '
         'walls and windows. They inspected buildings in the surrounding areas '
         'for unusual equipment, and searched customs records for evidence of '
         'any sound-emitting equipment brought into the country. On the basis '
         'of these data the committee found all the proposed explanations for '
         'the alleged sonic attack implausible and, in many cases, contrary to '
         'the laws of physics. The report addressed a number of hypotheses, '
         'listed below, for the alleged attack. Valdés-Sosa explained why the '
         'committee had dismissed them all:\n'
         'Audible sound—A blast of sound loud enough to damage hearing, '
         'Valdés-Sosa says, would have been obvious to anyone near the '
         'embassy, and the source could not selectively target different '
         'individuals in the same room. No loud sounds were reported by '
         'witnesses or nearby residents, and none were detected by '
         'surveillance equipment. Physicists on the committee found even '
         'deafening sounds beamed into the buildings would be diminished by '
         'the walls and windows to a level well below that required to cause '
         'hearing loss.\n'
         'Cell phone recordings of the alleged sonic attack were provided to '
         'an Associated Press reporter by an anonymous source in the State '
         'Department. But the sounds were identified by Yamile González '
         'Sánchez, an official at the Ministry of Public Health, and physicist '
         'Carlos Barceló Pérez, a professor at the National Institute of '
         'Hygiene, as those made by local insects, which they recorded on the '
         'scene. Moreover, the sounds, all in the audible range (about 7 '
         'kilohertz), would have overdriven the microphone—preventing it from '
         'recording—if they were loud enough to damage hearing.\n'
         'Audiograms (tests of hearing sensitivity) would have been useful in '
         'pinpointing the precise sound used in a sonic attack, because loud '
         'noise inflicts hearing loss at the specific frequency of the '
         'damaging sound. But despite requests from the committee, the U.S. '
         'declined to provide them. Hearing tests of residents in the '
         'surrounding area, made by audiologist Alida Suárez Landrián, found '
         'no abnormalities.\n'
         'Sound outside the range of human hearing—The physics of sound '
         'propagation and the existing medical literature do not support the '
         'concept of a weapon that uses sound waves above or below the audible '
         'range. The long wavelength of infrasound, as is it known, is '
         'difficult to focus and requires very large speakers to generate—and '
         'it would have been difficult to conceal, Valdés-Sosa says. '
         '“Ultrasound [frequencies too high to hear] can be focused, but it '
         'dissipates very fast,” he notes. “It would certainly be attenuated '
         'by the walls of the room.” Furthermore, he adds, ultrasound is used '
         'medically—for example, to image a fetus—but is not considered '
         'damaging to tissue. The device routinely placed in contact with a '
         'pregnant woman’s body typically uses a gel to improve sound '
         'penetration through skin.\n'
         'Infection and intoxication—Antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs can '
         'produce hearing damage. But Valdés-Sosa says the investigation could '
         'find no plausible way for such an agent to be administered '
         'selectively to people of such different ages who were affected in '
         'different places and times. The attacks are alleged to have occurred '
         'on multiple occasions between November 2016 and August 2017.\n'
         'The Caribbean Basin is home to many viral infections—dengue, '
         'chikungunya, Zika—but none have produced this constellation of '
         'symptoms. Indeed, Charles Rosenfarb, medical director of the State '
         'Department’s Bureau of Medical Services, describes the wide-ranging '
         'symptoms as a “novel syndrome” never seen before.\n'
         'The investigation was hampered by the cursory information provided '
         'to the Cubans by the U.S., Valdés-Sosa says. Rather than detailed '
         'medical records, the committee said it only received a single-page '
         'summary of complaints reported by embassy employees and family '
         'members—a list that included hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus, memory '
         'problems, difficulty concentrating and visual disturbances. “If we '
         'had the medical records, maybe we could exclude [a toxic agent], but '
         'this hypothesis seems also unlikely,” Valdés-Sosa says. The '
         'committee said its request to interview and examine victims was '
         'denied.\n'
         'Mass hysteria—Termed mass psychogenic illness by psychologists, mass '
         'hysteria has been suggested as the cause of the embassy employees’ '
         'complaints. A group of people can share a psychological state. For '
         'example, seeing someone else vomit may make another person feel '
         'nauseated. But diplomats and State Department employees are selected '
         'and trained to function in high-stress environments—including '
         'countries at war. Rosenfarb has ruled out the possibility of enough '
         'stress to produce sickness from a hysterical reaction.\n'
         'Peculiar structure outside the embassy—An array of metal poles and '
         'awnings in a park outside the embassy, also in a direct line of '
         'sight with the Capri Hotel, was thought to be a possible antenna '
         'system for a sonic or microwave weapon. But the structures are '
         'simply flag poles erected to obscure an electronic sign on the '
         'embassy that formerly flashed information objectionable to Cuban '
         'authorities. If it had served as a sonic weapon, “it would affect '
         'everyone in the building,” Valdés-Sosa adds.\n'
         'White matter damage— After the Cuban report was released, the '
         'Associated Press reported that magnetic resonance imaging scans by '
         'physicians at the University of Miami and Penn showed damage to '
         'white matter in the brains of embassy employees, and that this '
         'information would be published in a paper submitted to the Journal '
         'of the American Medical Association (JAMA). White matter is brain '
         'tissue comprised of bundles of cables (myelinated axons) that '
         'connect neurons (gray matter) to form circuits. But experts quoted '
         'in the AP article stated that sound does not damage white matter. '
         'Such damage would require violent concussive forces, something I '
         'learned in my own laboratory research on blast injury and '
         'myelin.\xa0 The lead author of the investigation finding white '
         'matter damage in embassy employees was identified by the Miami '
         'Herald as Michael Hoffer, a University of Miami ear, nose and throat '
         'specialist and former U.S. Marine physician. Hoffer referred my '
         'inquires to the University of Miami Press Office, which declined '
         'comment, unable even to clarify whether a manuscript showing white '
         'matter injury in the U.S. diplomats had been submitted for '
         'publication. At this point, no medical evidence of white matter '
         'damage is known to have been reported.\xa0\n'
         'The position of U.S. officials on the issue is still unclear. '
         'Officials at the State Department press office declined to comment '
         'on the reported evidence of white matter damage, or on questions '
         'about audio recordings purported to be a sonic weapon matching '
         'cricket sounds, or the possibility of mass hysteria afflicting the '
         'diplomats. They replied that they had no comment beyond department '
         'spokesperson Heather Nauert’s statements at a December 7, 2017 press '
         'conference.\n'
         '“This is part of the same pattern,” Valdés-Sosa says. “Something is '
         'leaked to the press, but in such a vague way you can’t confirm it or '
         'de-confirm it.” He also wants to know why data in the report had not '
         'been shared with the Cubans. “If there was any evidence of a real '
         'attack by anybody,” he says, “the Cuban government would react '
         'strongly—and as a scientist I would be very worried. I think the '
         'word would have to be spread so people could protect themselves.”\n'
         'In an editorial accompanying the article by the Penn team, '
         'Christopher Muth, Fishbein Fellow on the board of JAMA, and Steven '
         'Lewis, chief of Neurology at Lehigh Valley Health Network in '
         'Pennsylvania, wrote additional evidence must be obtained before '
         'reaching conclusions. The JAMA study depended on subjective reports '
         'made by patients and thus lacked the types of procedures brought to '
         'bear in a formal scientific study—it was not known, for instance, '
         'what the neurological status of the diagnosed patients was before '
         'they became ill. Many of the tests were only given to a small '
         'subgroup of patients. Just six patients received cognitive and '
         'neuropsychological tests. From a medical perspective, Muth and Lewis '
         'noted the range of symptoms is shared by many different medical '
         'illnesses apart from concussion.\n'
         'Those concerns were echoed by Valdés-Sosa in an e-mail after reading '
         'the report: “The study has serious limitations,” he wrote, but he '
         'was more disturbed by how this information was released. “The most '
         'alarming consideration is that medical data was withheld from the '
         'Cuban side to protect the patient privacy, but then it goes directly '
         'to publication,” he added. The Cuban scientists never questioned '
         'that these individuals experienced a range of health issues, he '
         'noted, but this new information does not clarify the cause or '
         'causes; indeed, it complicates matters. “The argument for a ‘new '
         'syndrome,’ or even of a ‘health attack,’ is very weak.” He added: '
         '“The objective findings [for example, abnormal audiograms] are '
         'present in only very few of the cases, and are inconsistent. It is '
         'not possible to know if any of the results are due to preexisting '
         'diseases or if their prevalence is larger than expected for any '
         'group of persons of the same age. The published conclusion that all '
         'the diplomats ‘sustained injury to widespread brain networks’ was '
         'not demonstrated by the data presented.”\n'
         'Some U.S. officials have suggested various theories for what might '
         'have happened. Rubio and others have suggested a rogue faction in '
         'Cuba could be responsible for the attacks. “People who think a rogue '
         'faction in Cuba is responsible do not know Cuba,” Valdés-Sosa says. '
         '“There is no rogue faction in Cuba.” In Cuba, often described as a '
         'police state, only the Communist Party is permitted by law—and an '
         'aggressive intelligence apparatus tracks and suppresses any '
         'dissident activity.\xa0 Under direct questioning by Sen. Rubio in '
         'the Senate Hearing on the sonic attack, Francisco Palmieri, acting '
         'assistant secretary of the State Department’s Bureau of Western '
         'Hemisphere Affairs, testified that he has never heard of any reports '
         'from any U.S. diplomats of a possible rogue faction in Cuba.\xa0\n'
         'The Cuban investigators do not question that some embassy employees '
         'became ill, but they say they can find no evidence this was caused '
         'by an attack. Embassy employees with military experience, '
         'Valdés-Sosa suggests, may have been exposed to loud blasts causing '
         'mild injury that worsens with age, resulting in tinnitus or sudden '
         'hearing loss as in Meniere’s disease, for example.\n'
         'Who would have a motive to advance a false story? “I think it is '
         'people that the U.S. government listens to, who want to roll back '
         'Obama’s work with Cuba, and they are taking advantage of this,” '
         'Valdés-Sosa says, suggesting perhaps some embassy personnel became '
         'ill from natural or preexisting causes—but when U.S. officials told '
         'them a secret weapon was involved, their anxiety may have '
         'skyrocketed.\n'
         'Many ordinary Cubans were also incredulous about the idea of an '
         'intentional attack, and insisted that their country is highly '
         'motivated to improve relations with their gigantic neighbor.\n'
         '“Science fiction,” says a restaurant worker in Havana, using a '
         'phrase often heard on the streets of the capital when this issue '
         'comes up. And one night in a remote village, as people dance salsa '
         'to the rhythm of Congo drums in the town square, a professional '
         'dancer says to me about the idea of an advanced new weapon: “I '
         'invite Americans to live in Cuba six months. We don’t have anything. '
         'No internet, no weapons program, not even cars.” Another Cuban adds, '
         '“If we had such a weapon, which we don’t, why would we use it on '
         'embassy employees and their families? We would not need bombs. We '
         'would take it to Trump Tower.”\n'
         'Back in Havana, a taxi driver in a 1942 Ford Fleetwood that jostles '
         'its rickety way through the streets in a predawn rain—the darkness '
         'pierced by one working headlight as the taxi driver squints through '
         'a streaky windshield—says point blank in broken English: “Story is '
         'false.”\n'
         '“Who is responsible, then?”\n'
         '“Donald Trump.”\n'
         'Asked why the U.S. would entertain such false information, he twists '
         'his two extended fists as if breaking a branch and says, “to break '
         'la cuerda [the rope]” tying the U.S. and Cuba together.\n'
         'The incident has also mystified some U.S. officials. “Very '
         'perplexing,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D–N.M.), after questioning '
         'Palmieri at the January 9 Senate hearing. “We need to be careful not '
         'to jump to conclusions until we know what really happened.” The same '
         'day, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced he would request an '
         'independent review board to investigate the matter.\n'
         'Valdés-Sosa ends our meeting, reflecting aloud: “If this is a hoax, '
         'it is cruel to have these people living under a shadow for the rest '
         'of their lives. Establishing what happened is important not only for '
         'the two countries, but for the people involved. The only way to do '
         'it is to share scientific information.”\n'

                'against society’s obsession with the Web, apps and social '
                'media—but it may just add to the confusion',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Tech Dealers Now Trying to Save the Tech “Addicts” They’ve Created',
 'text': 'A group of former Silicon Valley insiders recently issued a stark '
         'warning to the app-and update-obsessed public: Social media, the '
         'Web, mobile apps and other technologies developed to “monetize our '
         'attention” are “now eroding the pillars of our society,” according '
         'to the Center for Humane Technology. The new organization’s goal is '
         'to push tech companies to create products that benefit society, '
         'rather than simply manipulating people’s behavior for profit.\n'
         'Led by a former Google “design ethicist” as well as former managers '
         'at Mozilla (maker of the Firefox Web browser) and chipmaker Nvidia, '
         'the center faces several challenges. Foremost among them is the '
         'irony that it will have to rely on social media and the Web to reach '
         'a large enough audience to have any impact. The group also '
         'acknowledges the futility of trying to change the business practices '
         'of YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and other companies that '
         'make lots of money by grabbing and holding people’s attention.\n'
         'Instead, the organization—which includes a number of entrepreneurs '
         'who have already made fortunes helping peddle the possibly addictive '
         'technologies in question—will encourage tech companies to design new '
         'products that are less distracting and actually reduce the amount of '
         'time people spend staring at their screens. Another important aspect '
         'of the center’s charter is to pressure governments to create greater '
         'consumer protections.\n'
         'Is tech addiction a real condition? If so, how do you know if you’re '
         'addicted? And is the Center for Humane Technology a potential '
         'solution or just another distraction? Scientific American posed '
         'these and other questions to Simon McCarthy-Jones, an associate '
         'professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin '
         'in Ireland. McCarthy-Jones’s most recent book is Can’t You Hear '
         'Them? The Science and Significance of Hearing Voices; he has also '
         'written about the need to weigh the benefits and costs of social '
         'networking.\n'
         '[An edited transcript of the conversation follows.]\n'
         'At what point does incessant use of technology become an addiction, '
         'as opposed to a better way to work or occupy idle time?\r\n'
         'One way to consider whether tech use crosses over into addiction is '
         'to look at the six criteria that Mark Griffiths [a professor of '
         'behavioral addiction at Nottingham Trent University in England] has '
         'argued need to be met for a behavior to be deemed an addiction. '
         'Using social networking sites as an example, are these the '
         'overriding focus of your life, dominating your thoughts, feelings '
         'and behaviors? Are you using them to cause a specific change in your '
         'mood—for example, to induce euphoria or numbing? Do you need to '
         'increase your use of them to gain the same level of benefits? If you '
         'can’t access the site, does this have negative effects on you, such '
         'as irritability or headaches? Does your use of the site cause '
         'conflict with important people in your life such as your partner, '
         'children or employer? And do you continually fall back into your '
         'problematic social network use after periods of abstinence or being '
         'in control?\n'
         'If you meet all these criteria, you could be said to have a social '
         'networking site addiction, although this is not—yet—a recognized '
         'psychiatric disorder. The same approach can be applied to other '
         'online activities such as gaming. Indeed, internet gaming disorder '
         'is identified in the current edition of the DSM–5 [Diagnostic and '
         'Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition], psychiatry’s '
         'bible, as a condition recommended for further study. Gaming disorder '
         'has likewise made it into the beta draft of the World Health '
         'Organization’s forthcoming updated International Classification of '
         'Diseases.\n'
         'Why do so many people obsessively check their devices and social '
         'media accounts for updates?\r\n'
         'We can become addicted to certain tech products because our use of '
         'them is reinforced. They can help us fulfill a range of '
         'psychological needs such as belonging, status and competence. Using '
         'them can be intrinsically motivating, resulting in feelings of '
         'competence, excitement or of being “in the zone,” each of which has '
         'its own reward. Tech can also be extrinsically motivating; its use '
         'yields rewards from others, such as approval. Tech products can also '
         'help us avoid painful thoughts, feelings and realities. In a society '
         'where many people—particularly men—have proved in research '
         'experiments that they would rather electrocute themselves than sit '
         'in silence with their thoughts, the urge to get away from ourselves '
         'should not be underestimated. Also feeding the addictive behavior: '
         'Many tech products serve up rewards at unpredictable moments. For '
         'example, you never know when a status notification is going to pop '
         'up on Facebook. This encourages compulsive use.\n'
         'What makes someone prone to tech addiction?\r\n'
         'There are many such reasons, but let’s take three as examples. '
         'First, your personality influences how prone you might be to tech '
         'addiction. A Belgian study found people who used social network '
         'sites compulsively were less emotionally stable, less agreeable and '
         'less conscientious. Those people also had lower levels of perceived '
         'control and self-esteem. And compulsive social network users were '
         'more lonely and depressed than people who did not use these sites in '
         'this way. Second, there is evidence that possessing genetic variants '
         'associated with lower levels of dopamine function make you more '
         'likely to use internet video games excessively. And, third, why you '
         'are using tech products influences addiction proneness. For example, '
         'internet gaming addiction is associated with using such games to try '
         'and cope with negative emotions, to connect to people and to [master '
         'some skill].\n'
         'To point this out is not to blame the user. People are exposed to a '
         'powerful product designed to draw them in while living in [an '
         'actual] culture that at times seems callous and liable to push them '
         'away. Any answer to problematic tech use involves product, person '
         'and society.\n'
         'Is there evidence that gadget and social media companies have '
         'engineered their technology to be addictive?\r\n'
         'If someone were trying to design a tech product that was addictive, '
         'it would look a lot like many of the products on the market today. '
         'Indeed, market forces would appear to encourage the development of '
         'addictive tech products. Some companies advertise how their '
         'knowledge of mechanisms involved in addiction—such as dopamine '
         'release and learning theory—can be used to help other businesses '

         'A great article by the international human rights barrister Susie '
         'Alegre recently explored the relation between modern technology and '
         'the right to freedom of thought. As she notes, if freedom of thought '
         'involves the freedom to keep our thoughts private, how will this '
         'square with, for example, Facebook’s planned brain–computer '
         'interface? Alegre also observes that freedom of thought involves '
         'freedom from indoctrination or influence through manipulation. If we '
         'think of the now infamous 2014 Facebook newsfeed experiment [in '
         'which the company purposely manipulated information posted on '
         '689,000 users’ home pages] or the claim by Center for Humane '
         'Technology co-founder Tristan Harris that tech companies are '
         '“shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people” and are '
         '“programming people,” we may wonder if this right is currently being '
         'observed. \n'
         'Given we have an absolute right to freedom of thought, the Center '
         'for Humane Technology could consider this in their work. A '
         'human-rights based approach, focusing on potential tech violations '
         'of the absolute right to freedom of thought, could be a useful '
         'additional tactic for them. The center’s argument that tech’s '
         'manipulation of us is unethical suggests the tech should change. In '
         'contrast, if it were deemed that tech’s manipulation of us violates '
         'our absolute right to freedom of thought, this means the tech must '
         'change.\n',

 'description': 'Research shows the danger of too much early training',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'So, You Want Your Toddler to Grow Up to Win a Gold Medal',
 'text': 'Early specialization—encouraging kids to focus on mastering a single '
         'activity from a very early age—is a striking trend in today’s '
         'culture. Replacing Tiger Woods, the current poster child for this '
         'approach to training is the skier Mikaela Shiffrin, winner of the '
         'Olympic gold medal in the giant slalom earlier this month. Reading '
         'books such as Daniel Coyle’s The Talent Code, which argues that the '
         'idea of natural-born talent is a myth, Shiffrin’s parents developed '
         'a plan to gradually improve her skill. Shiffrin was on skis at age '
         '2, and her life has revolved around skiing ever since.\n'
         'The logic of early specialization is straightforward: Training is '
         'necessary to develop skill, but there is a limit to how much a '
         'person can train, not just because there are only 24 hours in a day, '
         'but because training is physically and psychologically exhausting. A '
         'person can train intensively for only a few hours a day without '
         'injuring themselves or getting burned out. Thus, the child who '
         'starts training early will have a virtually insurmountable training '
         'advantage over the child who starts later. Training is, of course, '
         'necessary to develop skill. However, the findings of a study '
         'recently published in the Journal of Sports Sciences show that later '
         'specialization may actually lead to better performance in the '
         'long-term.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n'
         'Professor Arne Güllich, director of the Institute of Applied Sport '
         'Science at the University of Kaiserslautern in Germany, compared the '
         'training histories of 83 athletes who medaled in the Olympics, or a '
         'World Championship event, to those of 83 athletes who competed at '
         'that level but did not medal. (The groups were matched on age, '
         'gender, and sport to control for any influence of these factors on '
         'the results. For every medalist in a given event, the sample '
         'included a non-medalist in that event of the same gender and roughly '
         'the same age.) The results showed that both the medalists and '
         'non-medalists started practicing in their main sport before the age '
         'of 12. However, the medalists started training in their main sport '
         'an average of 18 months later than the non-medalists. (The medalists '
         'started at age 11.8, on average, compared to age 10.3 for the '
         'non-medalists.) The medalists also accumulated significantly less '
         'training in their sport during adolescence and significantly more '
         'training in other sports. This pattern of results held across a wide '
         'range of sports, from skiing to basketball to archery. \xa0\xa0\n'
         'Along with reducing the risk of burnout and injury, allowing '
         'children to sample a range of activities before specializing allows '
         'a process known as gene-environment correlation to operate to its '
         'full extent. This is the idea that our genetically-influenced traits '
         'have an influence on the environments that we seek out and create '
         'for ourselves. As recently argued by the behavioral geneticist '
         'Elliot Tucker-Drob, gene-environment correlation is fundamental to '
         'understanding how expertise develops in children. For example, given '
         'the opportunity to try several sports, a child may discover that she '
         'has a high level of physical endurance and gravitate towards soccer '
         'because it places a premium on this attribute. She may also prefer '
         'soccer over other sports because she is extroverted and enjoys '
         'having teammates. In turn, after some initial success in the sport, '
         'the child’s coach may encourage her to continue playing soccer, '
         'setting in motion a “virtuous cycle” of effort followed by '
         'improvement, followed by further effort and improvement. However, '
         'this natural selection process will never unfold if the child isn’t '
         'given ample opportunity to try several sports before specializing.\n'
         'A likely reason why the early specialization approach has become so '
         'popular is that stories like those of Tiger Woods and Mikaela '
         'Shiffrin are so compelling. These anecdotes reinforce the belief '
         'that practically anyone can become a champion with the “right” '
         'environment. At the same time, it is possible that Woods and '
         'Shiffrin just happened to specialize in the “right” sport—one that '
         'matched their penchants and preferences. In other words, where the '
         'selection of a sport was concerned, they may have gotten lucky. Had '
         'they chosen another sport, they may not have been nearly so '
         'successful. \xa0\xa0\n'
         '\xa0Anecdotes are inadequate to make sound decisions about how best '
         'to train kids in sports and other activities. What is needed—and '
         'what is emerging through research by Arne Güllich and other sports '
         'scientists—is a body of empirical evidence that parents, teachers, '
         'and coaches can use as a basis for making decisions that will not '
         'only help youth reach the highest level of performance they can, but '
         'also maximize their enjoyment and minimize the risk of a host of '
         'negative outcomes.\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': '1 in 7 Teens Are “Sexting,” Says New Research',
 'text': 'The following essay is reprinted with permission from\xa0The '
         'Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\n'
         'Sexting is known as the sharing of sexually explicit images and '
         'videos through the internet or via electronic devices such as '
         'smartphones.\n'
         'One in seven teens report that they are sending sexts, and one in '
         'four are receiving sexts, according to our study of over 110,000 '
         'teens from around the world published today, Monday Feb. 26, in\xa0'
         'JAMA Pediatrics.\n'
         'Teen-to-teen sexting has generated considerable media attention, '
         'with news headlines mostly warning of\xa0the dangers of sexting.\n'
         'In January 2018, police in Châteauguay, near Montreal, launched a '
         'campaign called “sexts are porn” targeted at students aged 12 to 17. '
         'In the U.K., one police force recently\xa0warned parents they may be '
         'prosecuted\xa0if their children send indecent images over mobile '
         'phones.\n'
         'Naturally, this has many parents worried. Is consensual teen sexting '
         'a cause for concern?\n'
         'Sexting over the last decade has been on the rise, which is '
         'consistent with the rapid growth in the availability and ownership '
         'of smartphones. Teen sex, on the other hand, has been\xa0on the '
         'decline\xa0over the last decade.\n'
         'Our team conducted a meta-analysis of the research literature, '
         'drawing from 39 research studies on teen sexting internationally '
         'between 2009 and 2016.\n'
         'We found that approximately 15 per cent of teens are sending sexts. '
         'Meanwhile, around\xa041 per cent of teens are having sexual '
         'intercourse, according to a 2018 report from the Centers for Disease '
         'Control and Prevention in the United States.\n'
         'Considerable evidence suggests that teen sexting is related to\xa0'
         'sexual behaviour. Older teens are also sexting more often than '
         'younger teens. Taken together, it is not surprising that older teens '
         'are both more likely to sext and have sexual intercourse.\n'
         'Boys are often portrayed as the requesters, and girls as the '
         'senders, of nude images or videos. Findings from our study debunk '
         'this widely held assumption and show that boys and girls are equally '
         'likely to participate in sexting.\n'
         'Our study found that the large majority of teens are using their '
         'personal smartphones versus their computers to sext. In 2015, '
         'approximately 92 per cent of teenagers aged 15 to 17 in\xa0the U.S. '
         'owned a cell phone.\n'
         'With the ubiquity of smartphones and increasing digital usage across '
         'all age categories, parents should not be surprised that teens are '
         'engaging in sexting with other teens.\n'
         'Researchers suggest that consensual teen sexting may be a normal '
         'component of\xa0sexual behaviour and development\xa0in the digital '
         'age. The increased prevalence of this sexual behaviour, in older '
         'youth in particular, corresponds to their increasing interest in '
         'sexual exploration and identity development.\n'
         'Sexting has been linked to impulsive and\xa0risk-taking '
         'behaviours\xa0but, so far, the evidence for an association between '
         'sexting and\xa0poor mental health such as depression or '
         'loneliness\xa0is weak to non-existent.\n'
         'The most consistent predictor of consensual teen sexting is actually '
         'whether or not they want to flirt, be\xa0romantically involved with '
         'another teen, or maintain intimacy with their partner.\n'
         'Although girls and boys sext a similar amount, there are important '
         'differences in the perception of this behaviour among youth.\n'
         'Compared to boys, girls report feeling more pressure to sext, and '
         'also worry they will be judged harshly for sexting (e.g., slut '
         'shaming) or for not sexting (e.g., being called a “prude”).\n'
         'Boys, on the other hand, may see sexting as an opportunity to\xa0'
         'showcase their social status.\n'
         'This\xa0double standard may create higher levels of distress for '
         'girls.\n'
         'The moment the youth presses “send,” they are trusting that the '
         'receiver will not share the images or videos without their consent. '
         'Sexting can become a problem when this trust is violated.\n'
         'In many countries,\xa0it is illegal for a person to distribute an '
         'intimate photo without the explicit consent of the individual in the '
         'photo. Nonetheless, our research suggests that 12.5 per cent of '
         'teens are forwarding intimate photos without the consent of the '
         'sender.\n'
         'Taken together, several challenges can potentially arise. First, '
         'many teens may feel as though sexting is an expectation. Although '
         'likely not a warranted expectation, the idea that “my friends are '
         'doing it, then maybe I should do it” could be a strong peer '
         'motivator.\n'
         'A second problem that may arise is when teens are\xa0coerced into '
         'sexting or when they are “sextorted”\xa0(when images or videos are '
         'used as a form of threat or blackmail).\n'
         'Another problem is the idea of digital security. Teenage brains are '
         'still developing; their capacity to critically analyze the digital '
         'tools and apps they are using may not be enough to keep them safe.\n'
         'Where are these images stored? Who, other than the intended '
         'recipient, has access to them? How long are they kept digitally? '
         'And, if I change my mind can I get them back?\n'
         'These and many other questions are simply not at the forefront of '
         'the teenage mind—nor, arguably, are they always in an adult’s mind '
         'either,\xa053 per cent of whom engage in sexting themselves\xa0– '
         'especially when these thoughts are competing with sexual interest '
         'and intimacy.\n'
         'Parents can keep their teens aware and informed by having open '
         'discussions—about healthy dating relationships, peer pressure, '
         'digital security, sexuality and citizenship more broadly.\n'
         'The general consensus is that parents and caregivers should be '
         'proactive, rather than protective and reactive, about talking to '
         'their teens about sexting. Preaching abstinence is not effective. As '
         'with the issue of safe sex, this should be an ongoing conversation '
         'with your child instead of a one off “talk.”\n'
         'In these discussions, it is important to emphasize\xa0digital '
         'citizenship. Broadly, digital citizenship encourages individuals to '
         'act in a way that is safe, legal and ethical—in their online and '
         'digital interactions and behaviours.\n'
         'This is also an opportunity for parents and caregivers to emphasize '
         'that digital citizenship applies to adults as well. And such '
         'conversations can provide an opening for discussing other sensitive '
         'issues with teens, such as sexuality.\n'
         'It’s also important to discuss strategies for dealing with peer '
         'pressure to engage in sexting. And to discuss the potential '
         'consequences of sending sexts. Parents should emphasize cause and '
         'effect for teens. Once the videos or images have been sent, the teen '
         'forfeits control of who sees it.\n'
         'Sex and the digital world are two topics that can overwhelm parents '
         'and caregivers. Fortunately, there are some excellent resources on '
         'these issues to help guide conversations with your teens, '
         'including\xa0Digital Citizenship: Guide for Parents\xa0and\xa0Common '
         'Sense Media’s Sexting Handbook.\n'
         'If a parent or teen is concerned about videos and images being '
         'distributed without their consent, or if they are being coerced into '
         'sexting or sextorted, they should report their concerns immediately '
         'to their local police. In Canada, they can also consult\xa0'
         'needhelpnow.ca\xa0and send a report to\xa0Cybertip.ca. In the U.S., '
         'they can consult\xa0Stopbullying.org.\n'

         'morality and meaning, nothing really matters.\n'
         'One of the most prominent theologians of our time, William Lane '
         "Craig, committed Alvy's Error in a 2009 debate at Columbia "
         'University with Yale University philosopher Shelly Kagan when he '
         'pronounced: “On a naturalistic worldview, everything is ultimately '
         'destined to destruction in the heat death of the universe. As the '

         'worse for what we do. Our moral lives become vacuous because they '
         "don't have that kind of cosmic significance.”\n"
         "Kagan properly nailed Craig, referencing the latter's example of "
         'godless torturers: “This strikes me as an outrageous thing to '

         'matters to them, it matters to their family, and it matters to us.”\n'
         'Craig committed a related mistake when he argued that “without God '
         'there are no objective moral values, moral duties or moral '
         'accountability” and that “if life ends at the grave, then ultimately '
         'it makes no difference whether you live as a Stalin or a Mother '
         "Teresa.” Call this “Craig's Categorical Error”: assessing the value "
         'of something by the wrong category of criteria. In my new book, '
         'recently published, Heavens on Earth, I debunk the common belief '
         'that without God and the promise of an afterlife, this life has no '
         'morality or meaning. We live in the here and now, not the hereafter, '
         'so our actions must be judged according to the criteria of this '

 'text': 'When ‘Oumuamua, a mysterious interstellar object, swept through our '
         'solar system last October, it elicited breathless news stories all '
         'asking the obvious question—is it a spaceship? There were no signs '
         'it was—although many people seemed to hope otherwise.\n'
         'Throughout history most strange new cosmic phenomena have made us '
         'wonder: Could this be it, the moment we first face alien life? The '
         'expectation isn’t necessarily outlandish—many scientists can and do '
         'make elaborate, evidence-based arguments that we will eventually '
         'discover life beyond the bounds of our planet. To true believers, '
         'what may be more uncertain is whether or not such news would cause '
         'global panic—which depends on how our minds, so greatly influenced '
         'by our Earthly environment and society, would perceive the potential '
         'threat of something utterly outside our familiar context.\n'
         '“There’s this feeling amongst the public—a very large fraction of '
         'the public—that the discovery of intelligent life at least would be '
         'kept secret by the government because otherwise everybody would just '
         'go bonkers,” says Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute '
         'who was not involved with the study. Perhaps it might make sense for '
         'our brains—tuned by millions of years of evolution to be wary of '
         'predators—to freak out over immensely powerful alien beings arriving '
         'on our cosmic doorstep from parts unknown.\n'
         'But let’s say the situation hasn’t gone full “alien invasion” yet '
         'and malevolent starships aren’t sailing toward Earth, but rather we '
         'have read news of a definitive discovery of extraterrestrial life. '
         'How might we react then? Psychologists at Arizona State University '
         '(A.S.U.) used language-analyzing software to gauge feelings '
         'associated with 15 news articles about past discoveries that could '
         'have potentially been attributed to extraterrestrial life—reports '
         'covering items such as newfound Earth-like planets, mysterious '
         'astrophysical phenomena and possible life found on Mars. The '
         'articles used more positive and reward-oriented words than negative '
         'and risk-oriented ones, they report in a study published in January '
         'in Frontiers in Psychology. Although not in the paper, the team '
         'later similarly found articles about ‘Oumuamua skewed positive. They '
         'will report those results on Saturday in Austin, Texas, at the '
         'annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of '
         'Science.\n'
         '“I think we’re generally sort of positively predisposed to novelty, '
         'unless we have strong reason to suspect it could harm us,” says '
         'Michael Varnum, a psychologist at A.S.U. Tempe and the study’s '
         'senior author. “Of course, I’m not saying that if we got news that '
         'there were a bunch of large alien warships on their way towards '
         'Earth that we would be happy about it.”\n'
         '\r\n'
         'According to Varnum (and many astrobiologists), because simple, '
         'single-cellular life is presumably more cosmically common than '
         'star-crossing civilizations, it’s much more likely we will someday '
         'discover alien microbes rather than anything we could talk to. For '
         'his next set of experiments, he polled some 500 U.S. participants '
         'online to write about how they—and society in general—would react to '
         'news of such a discovery. Then he asked a separate group of around '
         '250 people to read and respond to an actual New York Times article '
         'from 1996 that reported the potential discovery of fossilized '
         'microbes in a Martian meteorite. He compared this first batch of '
         'responses with those from another group of 250 people who read a '
         '2010 New York Times article about the first synthetic life form '
         'created in a lab. He presented both stories without a dateline as if '
         'they were “fresh” off the press (although some participants likely '
         'realized they were not).\n'
         'After analyzing the emotional tenor of their responses, the team '
         'found the participants generally used more positive than negative '
         'words when describing both extraterrestrial and synthetic life. This '
         'positive-to-negative word ratio was greater when participants were '
         'responding to the discovery of extraterrestrial life compared with '
         'the creation of synthetic life, which could be an indication the '
         'data wasn’t skewed by, say, a possible human tendency to write or '
         'react positively.\n'
         'Participants tended to report they would respond more positively '
         'than society at large. Varnum thinks this could be because of a '
         'psychological tendency called “illusory superiority” in which a '
         'person thinks they have better qualities than others.\n'
         'But Shostak notes the methodology of the experiment might have '
         'biased readers toward a more positive response. Even if it didn’t, '
         '“I can’t say [the conclusion] was a big surprise to me,” he says. '
         '“If we were to announce tomorrow we found microbes on Mars, people '
         'would not start rioting in the streets…but I don’t think anybody '
         'thought they were going to riot in the streets.” If Martians landed '
         'in Silicon Valley, however, “I’d buy a lot of frozen pizzas and head '
         'for the hills—I mean, I’d be out of here, too,” he adds.\n'
         '\r\n'
         'If it’s a discovery somewhere in between the extremes of an '
         'extraterrestrial microbe and rapacious, hostile aliens laying siege '
         'to Earth, will people respond differently based on the era or '
         'society they live in?\n'
         'Our brains are wired with ancient circuits to defend us against '
         'predators. But as we navigate through the world, experience can also '
         'shape what we come to accept or to fear and how open we are to '
         'novelty. This study only looked at U.S. responses but two '
         'neuroscientists think the results might have been very different '
         'around the world. “If you look at societies that are much less open '
         'and much more xenophobic and so on, they might perceive [finding '
         'extraterrestrial life] as much more negative and unsettling,” says '
         'Israel Liberzon, a professor of psychiatry, psychology and '
         'neuroscience at the University of Michigan who was not part of the '
         'study.\n'
         '“Culture may be a strong determinant of how we respond to novelty,” '
         'says Cornelius Gross, a neuroscientist at the European Molecular '
         'Biology Laboratory–Rome who studies the neural circuitry of fear and '
         'was also not involved with the research. “People came to America '
         'because they were novelty seekers, so we’ve selected for [that] and '
         'then continued to foster novelty seeking and place it very high on '
         'our list.” Furthermore, Shostak says, a person’s religious beliefs '
         'could play a powerful role in shaping their reaction to learning '
         'that humanity is in fact not as universally special as many '
         'traditions hold.\n'
         'How we respond to such a situation can even be influenced by '
         'something as small as which extraterrestrial invasion movies people '
         'have seen or science fiction books they have read. If you see a lot '
         'of “UFO-type movies and the aliens are always ‘good’ in the end '
         'usually, then you might think that that stuff’s going to affect your '
         '[brain’s] prefrontal cortex,” Gross says. “And you’re going to '
         'adjust your responses to future novel [experiences].”\n'
         'But all in all, Liberzon notes, context is key. Individually or '
         'collectively, human beings will respond very differently to '
         'observing a lion at a zoo versus coming across one in the African '
         'savanna, just as we would when reading about an alien in a science '
         'fiction novel versus actually meeting one.\n'
         'And if scientists discover something so out of this world, '
         'literally, but also in the sense that we can’t compare it with '
         'anything we know, it seems futile, even silly, to make predictions '
         'about how humanity would react. Gross thinks we would probably first '
         'try to understand it, a reaction that can be interpreted as yet '
         'another ancient, evolutionarily sculpted defense system aimed at '
         'gaining control of a novel situation. There would probably be some '
         'positive responses and some negative ones, but they will all be '
         '“based on humans’ need to control their environment and make sure '
         'things are not threatening to them,” he says.\n'
         '“When we think about what forms life may take elsewhere, we’re '
         'really limited by the fact that we only know about what life has '
         'evolved to look like here,” Varnum says. But “my suspicion is in '
         'fact, the sort of stranger it is, the more excited people would '
         'be.”\n',

 'description': 'AI scientists try to trick smart systems into making dumb '
                'gaffes',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'How to Hack an Intelligent Machine',
 'text': 'This week Microsoft and Alibaba stoked new fears that robots will '
         'soon take our jobs. The two companies independently revealed that '
         'their artificial intelligence systems beat humans at a test of '
         'reading comprehension. The test, known as the Stanford Question '
         'Answering Dataset (SQuAD), was designed to train AI to answer '
         'questions about a set of Wikipedia articles.\n'
         'Like the image-recognition software already deployed in commercial '
         'photo apps, these systems lend the impression that machines have '
         'become increasingly capable of replicating human cognition: '
         'identifying images or sounds, and now speed reading text passages '
         'and spewing back answers with human-level accuracy.\n'
         'Machine smarts, though, are not always what they seem. The tech '
         'mavens who develop deep-learning networks and other AI systems are '
         'finding out just how fragile their creations are by drilling down to '
         'see if the machines really know anything. Stress-testing '
         'software—before it is loaded into a self-driving car, for '
         'instance—will be crucial to avoid the blunders that could lead to '
         'catastrophic accidents. “In some domains neural nets are actually '
         'superhuman, like they’re beating human performance,” says Anish '
         'Athalye, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student '
         'who researches AI. “But they have this weird property that it seems '
         'that we can trick them pretty easily.”\n'
         'Two preprint articles by Athalye and other students at MIT, '
         'collectively known as LabSix, demonstrated they could make a '
         'deep-learning system—one trained to recognize objects from thousands '
         'of examples—into thinking a picture of a skier was a dog (pdf) and a '
         'turtle was a rifle (pdf). A December paper from the Google Brain '
         'Team, the company’s AI research contingent, used a different '
         'approach to trick the system into classifying a banana as a '
         'toaster.\n'
         'In LabSix’s method an algorithm slightly modifies the color or '
         'brightness of every pixel in the image. Although the picture looks '
         'the same to you or me, these subtle changes cause the system to '
         'interpret it as something entirely different. Camouflaging the image '
         'modification “makes it more relevant to a real-world attack,” '
         'Athalye says. “If you see somebody put up a road sign in the real '
         'world that looks all psychedelic, people might think, ‘oh something '
         'fishy is going on here,’ and it will be investigated. But if you '
         'have something that looks like a speed limit sign to you but your '
         'self-driving car thinks it’s something completely different, that’s '
         'a much scarier scenario.”\n'
         'With the toaster, Google Brain took a different tactic. Instead of '
         'changing images individually, they wanted to develop a technical '
         'foil that could be placed in any scene. This meant creating a new '
         'unique image—an adversarial patch—that confuses the deep-learning '
         'system and distracts it from focusing on other items. Instead of '
         'blending in, the toaster patch needed to stand out. “Given that the '
         'patch only has control of pixels within the small circle that it’s '
         'in, it turned out that the best way for the patch to fool the '
         'classifiers was to become very salient,” Googler Tom Brown wrote in '
         'an e-mail. “A traditional adversarial attack changes all the pixels '
         'in a single image by a small amount. For the adversarial patch, we '
         'change a few pixels by a large amount.”\n'
         'To work outside a lab, the patch also had to be resilient to the '
         'visual noise in the real world. In earlier studies, just changing '
         'the orientation or brightness of the altered image could defeat the '
         'adversarial technique. A doctored picture of a cat viewed straight '
         'on is classified as guacamole, but turn the cat sideways and the '
         'system knows it’s looking at a cat again. The toaster patch, by '
         'contrast, can be presented in any lighting or orientation and still '
         'sabotage the system. “This was more difficult to develop because it '
         'meant training the patch in a wide variety of simulated scenes so '
         'that we could find a single patch that is successful in all of '
         'them,” Brown wrote.\n'
         'Although the examples are silly, the potential real-world '
         'implications are deadly serious. Athalye speculated an adversarial '
         'attack could trick a self-driving car into ignoring a stop sign. Or '
         'that it could disguise an x-ray image of a bomb during airport '
         'baggage screening. A goal of the research of Athalye and Brown is to '
         'help identify weaknesses in the technology before it is deployed.\n'
         'Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University, '
         'suggests AI is susceptible to being duped in this way because “the '
         "machine doesn't understand the scene as a whole,” he told me. AI can "
         'recognize objects but it fails to comprehend what the object is or '
         'what it’s used for. It is not “truly understanding the causal '
         'relationships between things, truly understanding who’s doing what '
         'to whom and why.”\n'
         'After the headlines about AI systems acing the reading-comprehension '
         'tests, Marcus disparaged the results, saying what the machine was '
         'doing had nothing to do with true comprehension. Marcus tweeted: '
         '“The SQuAD test shows that machines can highlight relevant passages '
         'in text, not that they understand those passages.”\n'
         'Instead of training an AI system on hundreds of thousands of '
         'examples, Marcus thinks the field should take its cues from '
         'cognitive psychology to develop software with a deeper '
         'understanding. Whereas deep learning can identify a dog and even '
         'classify its breed from an image it has never seen before, it does '
         'not know the person should be walking the dog instead of the dog '
         'walking the person. It does not comprehend what a dog really is and '
         'how it is supposed to interact with the world. “We need a different '
         'kind of AI architecture that’s about explanation, not just about '
         'pattern recognition,” Marcus says.\n'
         'Until it can do that, our jobs are safe—at least for awhile.\n',

                'networks” to develop creativity and originality by more '
                'fluidly mixing and matching real-world information',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'For AI to Get Creative, It Must Learn the Rules—Then How to Break '
         '‘Em',
 'text': 'American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Every artist was first '
         'an amateur.” He likely never thought those words would apply to '
         'machines. Yet artificial intelligence has demonstrated a growing '
         'aptitude for creativity, whether writing a heavy-metal rock album or '
         'producing an original portrait that is strikingly reminiscent of a '
         'Rembrandt.\n'
         'Applying AI to the art world might seem unnecessarily derivative; '
         'there are, of course, plenty of humans delivering awe-inspiring '
         'work. Proponents say, however, the real beauty of training AI to be '
         'creative does not lie in the end product—but rather in the '
         'technology’s potential to expand on its own machine-learning '
         'education, and to solve problems by thinking outside the box far '
         'faster and better than humans can. For example, creative '
         'problem-solving AI could someday make snap decisions that save the '
         'lives of the passengers in a self-driving car if its sensors fail, '
         'or propose unconventional combinations of chemical compounds that '
         'lead to new drugs for previously untreatable diseases.\n'
         'AI with a creative streak will be essential in developing highly '
         'automated systems that can respond appropriately to human life, says '
         'Mark Riedl, an associate professor at Georgia Institute of '
         'Technology’s School of Interactive Computing. “The fact is, we do '
         'lots of little bits of creativity every single day; lots of '
         'problem-solving goes on,” Riedl says. “If my son gets a toy stuck '
         'under the couch, I have to devise a tool out of a hanger [to '
         'retrieve it].”\n'
         'Riedl points out human creativity is also important in human social '
         'interactions, even telling a well-timed joke or recognizing a pun. '
         'Computers struggle with such subtleties. An incomplete understanding '
         'of how humans construct metaphors, for example, was all it took for '
         'an experiment in AI-generated literature to compose a new Harry '
         'Potter chapter filled with nonsensical sentences such as, “The floor '
         'of the castle seemed like a large pile of magic.”\n'
         'Still, getting machines to accurately mimic human style—whether '
         'Rembrandt’s or J. K. Rowling’s—is perhaps a good place to start when '
         'developing creative AI, Riedl says. After all, human creators often '
         'start off imitating the skills and processes of accomplished '
         'artists. The next step, for both people and machines, is to use '
         'those skills as part of a strategy to create something original.\n'
         'Today’s AI programs are not advanced enough to spontaneously compose '
         'hit songs or paint masterpieces. To get AI to do those things, '
         'humans must first calibrate a program by feeding it large numbers of '
         'examples. German AI artist Mario Klingemann, for instance, has '
         'designed artificial neural networks to assemble strange and '
         'beguiling images based on existing photographs and other visual '
         'artwork. An artificial neural network consists of a series of '
         'interconnected processing nodes, a system loosely based on the human '
         'brain’s neural structure. In an artificial network each electronic '
         '“neuron” takes in an array of numbers, performs a simple calculation '
         'on those inputs and then sends the result to the next layer of '
         'neurons—which in turn performs more complex calculations on the '
         'data.\n'
         'Klingemann’s approach involves feeding source material such as '
         'paintings and photographs into generative adversarial networks, or '
         'GANs, which combine the power of two neural networks. One network '
         'generates images based on a certain theme or set of guidelines; the '
         'other evaluates the images based on its knowledge of those '
         'guidelines. Thanks to feedback from the second network, the first '
         'gradually gets better at making images that more accurately adhere '
         'to the chosen theme. “Right now [the networks] are just tools that '
         'augment our own creativity,” Klingemann notes. “We as humans still '
         'have to recognize the creativity or novelty.” His goal is to build '
         'artistic networks that can independently select and even tweet out '
         'their own best work based on the given theme.\n'
         'Today’s GANs are strictly used to create new content or images '
         'within a broader creative system, says Alex Champandard, founder of '
         'creative.ai, a start-up that aims to develop AI tools for creative '
         'people. GANs are able to produce a lot of material quickly but still '
         'rely heavily on people to establish their guidelines, he adds.\n'
         'GANs’ content-generating capabilities are a good start when it comes '
         'to developing AI that can solve real-world problems, says Ian '
         'Goodfellow, a staff research scientist at Google and lead author of '
         'the 2014 paper that first described the concept of GANs. Goodfellow '
         'has been working on machine-learning models to let computers invent '
         'more dynamic narratives, which could go beyond limited scenarios '
         'such as planning out a series of chess moves—something computers '
         'have done extremely well for decades.\n'
         'Take a classic example of forward-planning that humans do all the '
         'time: When heading to the airport, we often fuzzily map out—purely '
         'in our heads—the expected key details of the journey, such as '
         'traffic patterns or road repairs. GANs could plan such a trip but '
         'they would likely do so in excruciating detail and come up with many '
         'possible routes to the destination, Goodfellow says. What we really '
         'need, he adds, is a layer of computation that looks at the many '
         'options produced by a neural network and intuitively decides which '
         'one is best.\n'
         'Another key component of human creative thinking is the ability to '
         'take knowledge from one context and use it within another. George '
         'Harrison picks up a sitar and applies his guitar-playing nous to the '
         'instrument. Shakespeare reads stories from Greek mythology and '
         'writes an English play inspired by those tales. A chief executive '
         'uses knowledge of military strategy, or perhaps chess, to plan a '
         'business deal.\n'
         'To that end, experiments are now underway with AI algorithms that '
         'can mix and match material. For example, researchers at the '
         'University of California, Berkeley, are using their '
         '“cycle-consistent adversarial network” (CycleGAN) to transform a '
         'video of horses into one of zebras. The AI detects the basic shape '
         'of a horse in the first video and can play with the aesthetic on top '
         'of that image, immediately and seamlessly swapping a shiny brown '
         'coat of hair for one with black-and-white stripes while the image is '
         'moving. Such work could be a stepping-stone to AI that can enable a '
         'self-driving car to adapt to unfamiliar road conditions, avoiding '
         'accidents. “If you’re gathering your [road-] training data mostly in '
         'California, you might not have a lot of real data [on] snowy '
         'situations,” Goodfellow says. “But you could take all your real data '
         'in sunny conditions and use [generative systems] to change it into '
         'snowy conditions.”\n'
         'This suggests teaching AI not only the rules, but also how to throw '
         'them out the window when necessary—much like amateurs who grow into '
         'artists.\n',

                'protein\xa0could improve diagnosis and drug trials',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': "A Big Step toward a Blood Test for Alzheimer's",
 'text': 'For the most part, clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease have been '
         'woefully disappointing—failed drug after failed drug. Even colossal '
         'drugmaker Pfizer announced earlier this month that it will stop '
         'pursuing treatments for the disorder out of scientific and financial '
         'frustration. Yet a Japanese study published Jan. 31 in Nature '
         'reports on a screening test that could improve the success of '
         'Alzheimer’s drug research.\n'
         'The new findings suggest a simple blood test can accurately predict '
         'levels of a protein called amyloid beta in the brain that begins '
         'appearing early in the course of the disease before symptoms appear. '
         'Amyloid buildup is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer’s, and '
         'determining the degree to which someone’s brain is riddled with the '
         'molecule is essential for designing effective clinical trials.\n'
         'At the moment the only way to accurately measure amyloid in a living '
         'person is either via costly positron emission tomography imaging '
         '(PET scan) or by sampling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a lumbar '
         'puncture, or spinal tap. A blood test would offer a cheaper, far '
         'less invasive means of determining a patient’s amyloid status. This '
         'could encourage more patients to enter clinical trials. It could '
         'also help researchers distinguish people with brewing Alzheimer’s '
         'from those with other forms of dementia.\n'
         'Senior study author Katsuhiko Yanagisawa, director general of the '
         'National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Japan, is '
         'convinced that enough amyloid penetrates the blood–brain barrier to '
         'make its way into the bloodstream to be a useful measure of '
         'cognitive function. “We think amyloid blood tests could replace '
         'costly, invasive amyloid tests, especially when it comes to '
         'detecting preclinical Alzheimer’s,” he says. “We hope our biomarker '
         'better facilitates clinical trials for [Alzheimer’s] by improving '
         'enrollment of participants.”\n'
         'To measure bits of amyloid coursing through the bloodstream, '
         'Yanagisawa and colleagues used a technique called '
         'immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, which deploysantibodies '
         'to bind and identify proteins. The study included 121 people from '
         'Japan and 252 from Australia, and both groups involved individuals '
         'with normal brain function, mild cognitive impairment and '
         'Alzheimer’s. They found the amount of amyloid present in the blood '
         'correlated with the degree of cognitive problems. Blood amyloid '
         'levels also correlated with findings in the same patients from PET '
         'scans and spinal fluid measures.\n'
         'Yanagisawa believes a simple amyloid blood test would enable '
         'recruitment for clinical trials of new drugs in a larger share of '
         'the population, as opposed to only those with access to advanced '
         'academic centers. Scaling up trial numbers should also help trials '
         'more accurately represent the actual population. “This does seem to '
         'be an important study,” says James Hendrix, who was not involved in '
         'the new research and is director of Global Science Initiatives for '
         'the Alzheimer’s Association, the largest nonprofit funder of '
         'Alzheimer’s research. “It is from a top research team. It is a '
         'decently large sample size. And most important, they are correlating '
         'their results to PET and CSF. That cross-validation to other '
         'techniques is great to see—we haven’t seen this before for a blood '
         'test in Alzheimer’s.”\n'
         'Emory University neurologist William Hu, who also did not '
         'participate in the study, agrees. “The findings are promising as '
         'reliable blood biomarkers can lead to early detection with a '
         'relatively straightforward procedure and lower costs. Yet he '
         'cautions the accuracy of amyloid PET scanning—the standard against '
         'which the blood test is being measured—remains controversial, '
         'compared with true gold standard of Alzheimer’s, a postmortem '
         'inspection of brain tissue.\n'
         'Hu also points out the overall levels of amyloid differed between '
         'the Japanese and Australian groups. “I believe the technology will '
         'need further development and standardization to provide more '
         'accurate amyloid measures,” he says.\n'
         'What little encouraging Alzheimer’s treatment data does '
         'exist—including that around a promising drug called '
         'aducanumab—suggests medications that have gone through clinical '
         'trials seem to work better earlier in the dementia disease course, '
         'before patients develop full-blown Alzheimer’s. A blood test in '
         'at-risk patients would make it an awful lot easier for researchers '
         'to identify people at risk for the disease in whom treatment and '
         'preventative measures could be more effective.\n'
         'Yanagisawa and colleagues are now extending and expanding their '
         'study in hopes of bringing an amyloid blood test closer to routine '
         'clinical use. Multiple authors on the paper have even filed for '
         'patents for the technique.\n'
         'For now, measuring dementia risk with a simple blood drawremains in '
         'the realm of research. “It’s good to see this type of study advance, '
         'as we desperately need noninvasive and low-cost markers for '
         'Alzheimer’s disease,” Hendrix says. “But still, at this point it is '
         'not ready for prime time.”\n',

         'Around\xa050m people\xa0worldwide are thought to have Alzheimer’s '
         'disease. And with rapidly ageing populations in many countries, the '
         'number of sufferers is steadily rising.\n'
         'We know that Alzheimer’s is caused by problems in the brain. Cells '
         'begin to lose their functions and eventually die,\xa0leading to\xa0'
         'memory loss, a decline in thinking abilities and even major '
         'personality changes. Specific regions of the brain also shrink, a '
         'process\xa0known as atrophy, causing a significant loss of brain '
         'volume. But what’s actually happening in the brain to cause this?\n'
         'The main way the disease works is to disrupt communication between '
         'neurons, the specialised cells that process and transmit electrical '
         'and chemical signals between regions of the brain. This is what is '
         'responsible for the cell death in the brain – and we think its due '
         'to a build up of two types of protein, called\xa0amyloid and tau. '
         'The exact interaction between these two proteins is largely unknown, '
         'but amyloid accumulates into sticky clusters known as beta-amyloid '
         '“plaques”, while tau builds up inside dying cells as '
         '“neurofibrillary tangles”.\n'
         'One of the difficulties of diagnosing Alzheimer’s is that we’ve no '
         'reliable and accurate way of measuring this protein build-up during '
         'the early stages of the disease. In fact, we can’t definitively '
         'diagnose Alzheimer’s until after the patient has died, by examining '
         'their actual brain tissue.\n'
         'Another problem we have is that beta-amyloid plaques can also be '
         'found in the\xa0brains of healthy patients. This suggests the '
         'presence of the amyloid and tau proteins may not tell the whole '
         'story of the disease.\n'
         'More recent research suggests\xa0chronic inflammation\xa0may play a '
         'role. Inflammation is part of the body’s defence system against '
         'disease and occurs when white blood cells release chemicals to '
         'protect the body from foreign substances. But, over a long enough '
         'period, it can also cause damage.\n'
         'In the brain, tissue-damaging long-term inflammation can also be '
         'caused by a build-up of cells known as microglia. In a healthy '
         'brain, these cells engulf and destroy waste and toxins. But in '
         'Alzheimer’s patients, the microglia fail to clear away this debris, '
         'which can include toxic tau tangles or amyloid plaques. The body '
         'then activates more microglia to try to clear the waste but this in '
         'turn causes inflammation. Long-term or chronic inflammation is '
         'particularly damaging to brain cells and ultimately leads to\xa0'
         'brain cell death.\n'
         'Scientists recently identified a gene called TREM2 that could be '
         'responsible for this problem. Normally TREM2 acts to guide microglia '
         'to clear beta-amyloid plaques from the brain, and to help fight '
         'inflammation within the brain. But\xa0researchers have found\xa0that '
         'the brains of patients whose TREM2 gene doesn’t work properly have a '
         'build-up of beta-amyloid plaques between neurons.\n'
         'Many Alzheimer’s patients also experience problems with their heart '
         'and circulatory system. Beta-amyloid deposits in the brain arteries, '
         'atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and mini-strokes\xa0may '
         'also be at play.\n'
         'These “vascular” problems can reduce blood flow in the brain even '
         'more and break down the blood-brain barrier, a structure that is '
         'critical for removing toxic waste from the brain. This can also '
         'prevent the brain from absorbing as much glucose –\xa0some '
         'studies\xa0have suggested this may actually occur before the onset '
         'of toxic proteins associated within Alzheimer’s disease within the '
         'brain.\n'
         'More recently, researchers have been looking deeper into the brain, '
         'specifically at the precise connections between neurons, known as '
         'synapses.\xa0A recent study\xa0published in Nature describes a '
         'process in the cells that may contribute to the breakdown of these '
         'synaptic communications between neurons. The findings indicate that '
         'this may happen when there isn’t enough of a specific synaptic '
         'protein (known as RBFOX1).\n'
         'Thanks to this kind of research, there are now many new drugs in '
         'development and in clinical trials that could target one or more of '
         'the many brain-wide changes that occur with Alzheimer’s disease. '
         'Many researchers now believe that a more personalised approach to '

         'challenge and pioneer a new way of treating this complex disease.\n'

 'text': 'The following essay is reprinted with permission from\xa0The '
         'Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\n'
         'October is a dismal time of year. The clocks go back, which '
         'accelerates the onset of darker evenings and the “shorter days” '
         'inevitably lead to calls for the tradition of putting clocks forward '
         'or backward to stop.\n'
         'Of course, the annual return to\xa0Greenwich Mean Time\xa0(GMT) '
         'from\xa0British Summer Time\xa0(BST) doesn’t make the days any '
         'shorter, it merely shifts an hour of available daylight from the '
         'evening to the morning. For many, lighter evenings are a priority '
         'and little attention is given to the benefits of lighter mornings. '
         'Arguments over clock changes tend to revolve around benefits for '
         'easier travel in lighter evenings. Nevertheless\xa0research '
         'suggests\xa0that holding onto lighter mornings might have hitherto '
         'unforeseen advantages. Light in the morning – more than any other '
         'time of day – leads to powerful\xa0brain-boosting effects, helping '
         'us\xa0to function\xa0as best we can, despite the approaching '
         'winter.\n'
         'All life on Earth has evolved around the 24-hour cycle of light and '
         'dark. An obvious sign is our desire for night-time sleep, but most '
         'biological functions are fine-tuned around day and night. Our bodies '
         'are honed to environmental light via a biological chain reaction.\n'
         'Light intensity is detected by\xa0special cells in the retina\xa0and '
         'this information is relayed to the internal body clock, located deep '
         'in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This sits '
         'in the hypothalamus, responsible for regulation of internal body '
         'processes using the endocrine system, which is linked to hormone '
         'secretion, via the pituitary gland. We are unaware of these light '
         'messages as they have nothing to do with conscious vision. Their '
         'sole job is to internalise information about environmental light '
         'intensity.\n'
         'The biological chain reaction continues with the brain driving the '
         'secretion of the hormone cortisol appropriate for the time of day – '
         'low levels in the dark and higher levels in the light. Cortisol is a '
         'powerful hormone with widespread effects on the brain and body. It '
         'is well known as “the stress hormone” but it is this underlying '
         '24-hour pattern that keeps us healthy.\n'
         'A robust burst in cortisol secretion occurs in the first 30 minutes '
         'after waking up. This is called the cortisol awakening response '
         '(CAR), and crucially this CAR is bigger when we wake up with light. '
         'So lighter mornings increase the CAR which in turn promotes better '
         'brain function so that we can tackle the day ahead.\n'
         'We have\xa0previously shown\xa0that people most badly affected by '
         'the changing seasons (those with\xa0seasonal affective disorder\xa0'
         '(SAD)) had lower CARs when waking up in the dark winter months. This '
         'was compared to a group of people not affected by changing seasons '
         'in winter as well as themselves in summer.\n'
         'Furthermore, those reporting greater seasonal depression, stress, '
         'anxiety and lower arousal exhibited the lowest winter CARs. However, '
         'winter awakening with the aid of an artificial light (dawn '
         'simulation) was\xa0able to restore the CAR. This finding is '
         'consistent with light exposure, especially morning light, being\xa0'
         'the most effective treatment\xa0for the winter blues.\n'
         'More\xa0recent research\xa0has explored what the CAR does in more '
         'detail, as part of healthy cortisol secretion. A bigger burst of '
         'cortisol in the morning (the CAR) has been linked\xa0with better '
         'brain plasticity\xa0(the capacity to learn) and function – '
         'especially better goal-setting, decision-making and planning (what '
         'we call the executive function). Indeed the decline in the CAR with '
         'ageing\xa0has been associated\xa0with worse executive function.\n'
         'Morning awakening is a striking and important biological event – the '
         'tipping point of the day. A rapid burst of cortisol secretion '
         'kickstarts the day by synchronising widespread biological systems. '
         'This powerful hormone rapidly sweeps throughout the body where it is '
         'recognised by receptors on all body cells. These receptors generate '
         'the next stage in the biological chain reaction to ensure we are '
         'appropriately prepared and energised for the challenges of the day '
         'ahead. Smaller CARs mean we do not function optimally.\n'
         'So on dark winter mornings it can be more difficult to mount a '
         'robust burst of cortisol in the morning. This is because both '
         'awakening and light are the stimuli for this crucial tipping point '
         'of the day. A lack of light in the morning can diminish the '
         'biological chain reaction and make many of us feel below par and not '
         'function at full throttle. Ironically this would be most marked for '

 'text': 'Young adults with autism have an unusual gait and problems with fine '

         'at the\xa02017 Society for Neuroscience annual meeting\xa0in '
         'Washington, D.C.\n'
         'Motor problems such as clumsiness, toe-walking and altered gait '
         'are\xa0well documented in autism. But most studies have been limited '
         'to children or have included adults only as part of a broad age '
         'range.\n'
         '“Studies haven’t focused on just adults,” says Cortney Armitano, a '
         'graduate student in\xa0Steven Morrison’s lab at Old Dominion '
         'University in Norfolk, Virginia, who presented the work.\n'
         'The researchers looked at 20 young adults with autism between the '
         'ages of about 17 and 25, and 20 controls of about the same age '
         'range. They put these participants through a battery of standard '
         'tests of fine motor skills, balance and walking.\n'
         'When it comes to simple tasks—such as tapping a finger rapidly '
         'against a hard surface or standing still without swaying—those with '
         'autism perform just as well as controls do.\n'
         'But with activities that require more back-and-forth between the '
         'brain and the rest of the body, differences emerge.\n'
         'Adults with autism have slower reaction times compared with '
         'controls, measured by how fast they can click a computer mouse in '
         'response to seeing a button light up. They also have a weaker grip.\n'
         'The researchers also documented altered gait in young adults with '
         'autism. These individuals take longer to take a step or a full '
         'stride, and have shorter strides than controls do. This means that '
         'they walk more slowly overall.\n'
         'Looking at a wide range of motor skills simultaneously enabled the '
         'researchers to draw broader conclusions. Because tasks involving '
         'both the upper and lower limbs are affected, the results suggest '
         'slower overall processing of motor information rather than '
         'difficulty with a specific task.\n'
         'The findings are consistent with\xa0studies of motor skills\xa0in '
         'children with autism.\n'
         'How these motor problems affect the lives of adults with autism '
         'isn’t known. However, similar decreases in walking speed and '
         'reaction time in typical adults as they age increase their risk of '
         'falls.\n'
         'The participants are only in their 20s, but “they’re looking more '
         'like older adults,” Armitano says. (The researchers have not '
         'directly compared these groups.)\n'
         'The results suggest a need to study whether motor skills in\xa0older '
         'adults with autism\xa0decline more sharply than in their typical '
         'peers, she says. Some research suggests that older adults with '
         'autism are at increased risk of motor symptoms\xa0consistent with '
         'Parkinson’s disease.\n'

         'present the results on 4 November at\xa0the 10th Clinical Trials on '
         'Alzheimer’s Disease conference\xa0in Boston, Massachusetts.\n'
         'Wyss-Coray and his colleagues tested people aged between 54 and 86 '
         "with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The team gave the 18 "
         'subjects weekly infusions for four weeks. They received either a '
         'saline placebo or plasma—blood from which the red cells have been '
         'removed—from blood donors aged 18–30. During the study, the team '
         'monitored the patients to assess their cognitive skills, mood and '
         'general abilities to manage their lives independently.\n'
         'The study detected no serious adverse reactions. It saw no '
         'significant effect on cognition, but two different batteries of '
         'tests assessing daily living skills both showed significant '
         'improvement.\n'
         "The human trial grew out of earlier 'parabiosis' experiments, in "
         'which the blood systems of two rodents are surgically joined '
         'together to see what happens when molecules circulating in one '
         'animal enter another animal.\n'
         'Wyss-Coray, whose group did most of the mouse studies that inspired '
         'the clinical trial, now plans to conduct a second, larger trial '
         'using plasma from which many proteins and other molecules have been '
         'removed. He told\xa0Nature\xa0that his experiments in mice suggest '
         'that such a treatment could be more effective than using whole '
         'plasma.\n'
         'Blood-transfusion trials are controversial because the active '
         'molecules in plasma that seem to lead to\xa0the purported effects '
         'are unknown.\n'
         'Irina Conboy, a neurologist at the University of California, '
         'Berkeley, and her colleagues have performed extensive parabiosis '
         'experiments stitching together young and old mice that have been '
         'genetically matched. She has found that young blood clearly '
         'rejuvenates mouse tissues such as the heart and the brain. But she '
         'says that the effects are probably coordinated by a complex '
         'orchestration of factors in the blood that needs to be understood '
         'more fully before moving to the clinic.\n'
         '“The scientific basis for the trial is simply not there,” she says. '
         '“The effects of young blood on cognition have not been replicated by '
         'an independent group, and there has never been a test with a mouse '
         'model of Alzheimer’s.” She says that frequently exposing older '
         'people to foreign plasma may be unsafe, because hyperactivation of '
         'their immune systems could lead to autoimmune or inflammatory '
         'disease.\n'
         'But, Wyss-Coray says, “Alzheimer’s patients don’t want to wait until '
         'the exact mode of action is discovered.”\n'
         'He says that it is the first new approach for Alzheimer’s disease '
         'that is not based on the prevailing theory that the disease is '
         'caused by rogue amyloid-β or tau molecules in the brain, which has '
         'so far failed to result in any treatments.\n'
         'Blood transfusions used for this purpose do not require approval by '

         "With rapidly rising numbers of people suffering from Alzheimer's and "

         '"It\'s a huge problem, a growing problem, and the scale of the '
         'tragedy - even for the people who stay alive - is very high," he '
         'said.\n'
         'Despite decades of scientific research, there is no treatment that '
         "can slow the progression of Alzheimer's. Current drugs can do no "

         'he\'s "optimistic" treatments can be found, even if they might be '

         '"I hope that in the next 10 years that we have some powerful drugs, '

         "Dementia, of which Alzheimer's is the most common form, affects "

         'The philanthropist, whose usual focus is on infectious diseases in '

         'Much of the push toward self-driving cars has been underwritten by '
         'the\xa0hope that they will save lives\xa0by getting involved in '
         'fewer crashes with\xa0fewer injuries and deaths\xa0than human-driven '
         'cars. But so far, most comparisons between human drivers and '
         'automated vehicles have been at best uneven, and at worst, unfair.\n'
         'The statistics\xa0measuring how many crashes occur\xa0are hard to '
         'argue with:\xa0More than 90 percent\xa0of car crashes in the U.S. '
         'are thought to involve some form of\xa0driver error. Eliminating '
         'this error would,\xa0in two years, save as many people as the '
         'country lost in\xa0all of the Vietnam War.\n'
         'But to me, as a\xa0human factors researcher, that’s not enough '
         'information to properly evaluate whether automation may actually be '
         'better than humans at not crashing. Their respective crash rates can '
         'only be determined by also knowing how many non-collisions happen. '
         'For human drivers is it one collision per billion chances to crash, '
         'or one in a\xa0trillion?\n'
         'Assessing the rate at which things do not happen is extremely '
         'difficult. For example, estimating how many times you didn’t bump '
         'into someone in the hall today relates to how many people there were '
         'in the hallway and how long you were walking there. Also, people '
         'forget non-events very quickly, if we even notice them happening. To '
         'determine whether automated vehicles are safer than humans, '
         'researchers will need to establish a non-collision rate for both '
         'humans and these emerging driverless vehicles.\n'
         'Crash statistics for human-driven cars\xa0are compiled from all '
         'sorts of driving situations, and on all types of roads. This '
         'includes people driving through pouring rain, on dirt roads and '
         'climbing steep slopes in the snow. However, much of the data on '
         'self-driving cars’ safety comes\xa0from Western states\xa0of the '
         'U.S., often in good weather. Large amounts of the data have been '
         'recorded on unidirectional, multi-lane highways, where the most '
         'important tasks are staying in the car’s own lane and not getting '
         'too close to the vehicle ahead.\n'
         'Automated cars are\xa0rather good at those kinds of tasks\xa0– but '
         'then again, so are humans. The data on fully automated systems will '
         'naturally expand to cover more roads as\xa0states allow automated '
         'vehicles\xa0to operate more widely. But it will take some time '
         'before self-driving cars can cover as many miles in a year and in as '
         'many circumstances as human drivers presently do.\n'
         'It is true that self-driving cars don’t get\xa0tired, angry, '
         'frustrated or drunk. But neither can they yet react to uncertain and '
         'ambiguous situations with the same skill or anticipation of an '
         'attentive human driver, which suggests that perhaps the two still\xa0'
         'need to work together. Nor do purely automated vehicles possess the '
         'foresight to avoid potential peril: They largely drive from moment '
         'to moment, rather than thinking ahead to possible events '
         'literally\xa0down the road.\n'
         'To an automated vision system, a bus shelter full of people\xa0might '
         'appear quite similar to an uninhabited corn field. Indeed, deciding '
         'what action to take in an emergency is difficult for humans, but '
         'drivers have\xa0sacrificed themselves for the greater good of '
         'others. An automated system’s\xa0limited understanding of the '
         'world\xa0means it\xa0will almost never\xa0evaluate a situation the '
         'same way a human would. And machines can’t be specifically '
         'programmed in advance to\xa0handle every imaginable set of events.\n'
         'Some people may argue that the promise of simply reducing the number '
         'of injuries and deaths is enough to justify expanding the use of '
         'driverless cars. I do agree that it would be a great thing if '
         'tomorrow were the dawn of a new day when a completely driverless '
         'roadway killed or injured no one; although such an arrangement '
         'might\xa0suck more of the enjoyment\xa0from our everyday lives, '
         'especially for those who love driving.\n'
         'But experience from aviation shows that as new automated systems are '
         'introduced, there is\xa0often an increase in the rate of adverse '
         'events. Though temporary, this potential\xa0uptick in the crash '
         'rate\xa0may cause concern for the general public and then '
         'politicians, lawmakers and even manufacturers – who\xa0might be '
         'discouraged\xa0from sticking with the new technology.\n'
         'As a result, comparisons between humans and automated vehicles have '
         'to be performed carefully. This is particularly true because '
         'human-controlled vehicles are likely to remain on the roads for many '
         'years and even decades to come. How will people and driverless cars '
         'mix together, and\xa0who will be at fault for any collisions\xa0'
         'between them?\n'
         'To fairly evaluate driverless cars on how well they fulfill their '
         'promise of improved safety, it’s important to ensure the data being '
         'presented actually provide a true comparison. Choosing to replace '
         'humans with automation has more effects than simply a\xa0one-for-one '
         'swap. It’s important to make those decisions mindfully.\n'

 'name': 'Scientist Concedes His Controversial MS Therapy is “Largely '
         'Ineffective”',
 'text': 'What many hope will be the final chapter in an unfortunate saga in '
         'multiple sclerosis research appears to have been written by the '
         'scientist who started the affair in the first place.\n'
         'Italian physician Paolo Zamboni has publicly acknowledged that a '
         'therapy he developed and dubbed “the liberation treatment” does not '
         'cure or mitigate the symptoms of MS. A randomized controlled '
         'trial—the gold standard of medical research—he and other Italian '
         'researchers conducted concluded the procedure is a “largely '
         'ineffective technique” that should not be recommended for MS '
         'patients.\n'
         'The trial’s result comes as no surprise to neurologists, most of '
         'whom felt Zamboni’s theory lacked plausibility from the moment news '
         'of it exploded through the MS community in 2009.\n'
         'Many of those same neurologists, though, saw their relationships '
         'with their patients fractured as belief in the liberation therapy '
         'took hold in the community of patients and their families in Canada, '
         'parts of the United States, and farther afield. Doctors advising '
         'caution against a procedure that hadn’t been proved to work or even '
         'to be safe were derided as standing in the way of innovation to '
         'protect their own practices.\n'
         'Dr. Jock Murray, an MS expert and retired professor from Dalhousie '
         'University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said the history of MS is laden '
         'with incidences like the Zamboni episode—though he said this one '
         'lasted longer than most.\n'
         '“Belief always trumps evidence,” Murray told STAT in an interview '
         'Monday.\n'
         'Zamboni, who works at University of Ferrara Hospital, did not '
         'respond to STAT’s email inquiry about the trial.\n'
         'The vascular surgeon was moved to look for the cause of MS because '
         'his wife suffers from the disease. In 2009, Zamboni published a '
         'paper suggesting the neurological damage the condition causes was '
         'triggered by pooling of blood in the brain that was the result of '
         'inadequate drainage.\n'
         'He called the condition—which he said was common among MS '
         'patients—“chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency,” or CCSVI.\n'
         'Zamboni further suggested inserting stents—which are designed to '
         'hold open arteries—into veins in the neck would increase blood '
         'drainage and improve symptoms.\n'
         'His 2009 study appeared to show it worked, though skeptics were '
         'quick to note major flaws. There were no controls—a group that '
         'didn’t get the treatment to use as comparators—and both the patients '
         'and the doctors knew everyone was treated. A study of this kind is '
         'open to the placebo effect and to researcher bias—both of which can '
         'result in individuals seeing something they hoped to see.\n'
         'Zamboni’s recently published study is the type his critics would '
         'have liked him to have done the first time—a double-blind randomized '
         'controlled trial in which neither patients nor the researchers '
         'assessing whether there were improvements post-treatment knew which '
         'patients got the actual procedure and which received a sham '
         'therapy.\n'
         'The Italian researcher’s 2009 claim received some prominent and '
         'unchallenging coverage from a couple of major Canadian media '
         'outlets, and the clamoring for the procedure began.\n'
         '“These patients looked like they were miraculous. And that got '
         'played over and over and over. Within 72 hours, everybody in '
         'Canada—all the patients and their families—knew about this new '
         'procedure,” said Murray. “So there was a great demand then for '
         'everyone to seek it out.”\n'
         'Patients weren’t willing to wait for science to conclude if Zamboni '
         'was correct or if his treatment was safe. Clinics sprang up in a '
         'number of countries—Poland, Costa Rica, and India among '
         'them—offering the controversial procedure. Many came home '
         'rapturously claiming benefit, only to see what others suggested was '
         'a placebo effect wane over time. A few people who underwent the '
         'procedure died.\n'
         'Patients pressured the MS societies in the U.S. and Canada to '
         'advocate for access to the treatment, and in Canada, there were '
         'strident calls for the national health care system to pay for the '
         'procedure.\n'
         'Meanwhile, the scientific community scrambled to try to test '
         'Zamboni’s theory and the procedure. Study after study concluded his '
         'idea was wrong. In fact, a key study in 2014 concluded that the neck '
         'veins of MS patients were no different from those of people who '
         'don’t have the condition. But disproving a theory takes time. And '
         'hope dies reluctantly.\n'
         'Millions of dollars were spent trying to see if Zamboni was correct. '
         'Untold research hours were diverted from other lines of MS inquiry. '
         'Previously collaborative relationships between doctors and patients, '
         'as well as patients and the foundations set up to advocate for their '
         'needs, were damaged, Murray said. “It caused a lot of trouble.”\n'
         'Earlier this year, Canadian researchers reported on a large, '
         'randomized double-blinded study—the kind designed to protect against '
         'researcher bias and the placebo effect—they had conducted on the '
         'liberation treatment. The results, presented to the Society of '
         'Interventional Radiology’s annual scientific meeting in March, '
         'showed the technique didn’t work. The study is currently under '
         'review at a top-tier medical journal, lead author Dr. Anthony '
         'Traboulsee, an associate professor of neurology at the University of '
         'British Columbia, said Tuesday.\n'
         '“We hope these findings, coming from a carefully controlled, ‘gold '
         'standard’ study, will persuade people with MS not to pursue '
         'liberation therapy, an invasive procedure that carries the risk of '
         'complications, as well as significant financial cost,” Traboulsee '
         'said at the time of presentation.\n'
         'And now, Zamboni’s paper showing the same has been published in JAMA '
         'Neurology.\n'
         'The liberation treatment is one in a long list of therapies that '
         'have been embraced by the MS community but were ultimately found to '
         'be ineffective, said Murray. Hyperbaric oxygen chambers, snake '
         'venom, anti-coagulants, histamine desensitization therapy—all have '
         'had their turn.\n'
         'The particular nature of MS—for a lot of patients, symptoms worsen, '
         'then ease before worsening again—makes it easy to appear as if a '
         'treatment has had a benefit, Murray noted.\n'
         'He worried about the impact these episodes have on the MS community. '
         '“To have one after another fail, of this kind of thing, is very '
         'disheartening. And then they don’t know who to believe.”\n'

 'text': 'Researchers have exploited the twisty nature of\xa0topological '
         'physics\xa0to produce a high-quality beam of laser light—a step that '
         'could lead to the first practical application of this burgeoning '
         'field. A team of physicists describes its device, and the theory '
         'behind the technology, in two studies\xa0published on February 1 '
         'in\xa0Science.\n'
         'The demonstration “brings topological photonics substantially closer '
         'to real applications”, says Marin Soljai, a physicist at the '
         'Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n'
         'Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies shapes and their '
         'possible arrangements in space—from simple knotted loops to the '
         'higher-dimensional universes of string theory. Since\xa0the 1980s, '
         'physicists have discovered a number of states of matter\xa0that '
         'derive odd properties from topological phenomena, such as the way '
         'that magnetization—pictured as a field of arrows—winds around a '
         'material. (Some of the founders of the field received the\xa02016 '
         'Nobel Prize in Physics.)\n'
         'In particular, theorists have predicted—and experimentalists have '
         'confirmed—that certain insulating solids can, counterintuitively, '
         'conduct electricity thanks to topological properties. The currents '
         'arise from flows of electrons on the materials’ surfaces, and they '
         'have a unique advantage: the wavy patterns—like knotted loops—can be '
         'difficult to disrupt. This feature, known as topological protection, '
         'enables electrons to flow unimpeded. It prevents electron flows from '
         'changing direction or bouncing back off imperfections, which '
         'decrease efficiency.\n'
         'Physicists have also observed topological protection in '
         'electromagnetic waves. In a solid, topological effects emerge when '
         'electrons manoeuvre their way around the arrangement of atoms. '
         'Similarly, photons of light can be made to negotiate a material that '
         'has a regular pattern of gaps. “There are many types of topological '
         'phenomena that can happen in almost any wave system in nature, when '
         'you make it periodic,” says Soljai, whose team found some of the '
         'first experimental evidence of topological photonics about a decade '
         'ago.\n'
         'In the latest studies, Mordechai Segev of the Technion Institute in '
         'Haifa, Israel, and his collaborators used topological photonics to '
         'create a laser beam, in which the light waves are in phase.\n'
         'The team etched an array of circular channels into the surface of a '
         'chip of semiconductor material, and cast infrared light onto the '
         'structure from above. The circles—each a few microns in '
         'diameter—caught light waves only of precise wavelengths, which then '
         'moved from one loop to the next.\n'
         'In photonic systems, the direction of wave propagation is usually '
         'reversible. An effort last year to make a topological laser, led by '
         'Boubacar Kanté at the University of California, San Diego, used '
         'magnetic fields to constrain propogation.\n'
         "But in Segev's system, some loops were asymmetrically shaped, which "
         'made the light flow preferentially in one direction. As the system '
         'received increasing energy from the infrared source, the circulating '
         'light pulse was reinforced, or amplified. Eventually, the light '
         'waves bounced out of an exit channel—pulsating in step as a focused '
         'laser beam.\n'
         'The experiments, carried out with collaborators at the University of '
         'Central Florida in Orlando, showed that the lasers were more '
         'energetically efficient and produced higher-quality beams—meaning '
         'they came closer to being a perfect, sinusoidal wave—than similar '
         "lasers that don't use topology. Thanks to topological protection, "
         '“the system has inherited robustness against imperfections”, says '
         'Segev.\n'
         'The devices by both Segev’s and Kanté’s teams are “very important '
         'and exciting developments”, says Mohammad Hefezi, a photonics '
         'researcher at the University of Maryland in College Park. But he '
         'says that more tests will be needed to confirm whether Segev’s laser '
         'performs better than existing devices.\n'
         'Most physicists had been sceptical that topological photonics could '
         'be compatible with laser-light generation, Segev says. Although '
         'topological ideas first arose in the theory of solid-state matter '
         'and are seen by many researchers as promising for electronics, few '
         'practical applications exist. It’s no coincidence that the first '
         'topological devices to market could be in photonics. These systems '
         'are often easier to work with than solid-state ones, Soljai says. '
         'Researchers can create periodically patterned structures with almost '
         'any properties they want to pass light through, whereas the atoms in '
         'materials cannot be arranged in arbitrary ways.\n'

 'text': 'As athletes from around the globe converge on Pyeongchang, South '
         'Korea, for the 2018 Winter Olympics, they must steel themselves for '
         'winds that will whip in from the Manchurian Plain and Siberia and '
         'fan icy temperatures that are likely to drop to around 7 degrees '
         'Fahrenheit. Meteorologists say this year’s games will likely be the '
         'coldest Olympics since Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994—a year when the '
         'opening ceremony was so frigid organizers had to cancel plans to '
         'release doves because they worried the birds would suffer.\n'
         'For the designers and engineers who spend years crafting Team USA’s '
         'uniforms to offer both style and extraordinary aerodynamics, the '
         'need to keep athletes warm in these extreme temperatures posed an '
         'added dimension of difficulty. And Ralph Lauren, the brand '
         'outfitting the American team for the opening and closing ceremonies, '
         'was up against the most daunting challenge. Those two outdoor events '
         'take place at what will likely be the coldest location of the entire '
         'competition: the roofless, open-air Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. In '
         'November six people attending a concert there reportedly developed '
         'hypothermia.\n'
         '“We knew about the cold,” says David Lauren, chief innovation '
         'officer at Ralph Lauren, “and hit on the idea of using wearable '
         'technology to keep our athletes warm.” The result: bonded to the '
         'interior of the red, white and blue opening ceremony parkas are '
         'printed strips of electronic, heat-conducting metallic ink, made of '
         'silver and carbon (in the shape of an American flag, of course)—sort '
         'of like a stylish electric blanket, but with ink instead of wires.\n'
         'Athletes will be able to activate their self-warming jackets by '
         'pushing a button on a slim lithium-ion battery pack. Once switched '
         'on, electrons will surge through the silver ink till they hit a '
         'resistive carbon pad, which will generate heat. The system is '
         'designed to provide up to 11 hours of warmth, and has three settings '
         'so athletes can control their own temperatures. The technology was '
         'adapted from heated car seats and made more stretchy and flexible '
         'for the Ralph Lauren Olympic apparel, according to the company. The '
         'white waterproof bomber jackets Team USA will wear for the closing '
         'ceremony are equipped with the same ink-based technology.\n'
         'Athletes on the U.S. bobsled team will also be outfitted with '
         'innovative suits that designers say will provide anywhere from two '
         'to four degrees Fahrenheit of extra warmth as they hurtle down the '
         'outdoor course at 90-plus miles per hour. The added heat comes from '
         'a novel fabric technology designed to lock in body warmth known as '
         '“ColdGear Infrared”—a proprietary blend of compounds including '
         'ceramic material, a common thermal insulator. The CGI will be '
         'embedded in the fabric’s fleece lining, the company says. “When you '
         'wear it against your skin it absorbs and retains your body heat,” '
         'says Mark Cumiskey, a textile engineer and senior director of '
         'materials innovation at Under Armour, the company that designed the '
         'U.S. bobsled and speed skating teams’ uniforms. (The makers of CGI '
         'fabric claim it retains heat longer than similar fabrics.) “The '
         'added warmth will be most important right before the race, when the '
         'athletes are standing on the top of a mountain in what amounts to a '
         'tight, stretchy base layer,” says Chris Laughman, Under Armour’s '
         'senior product manager for Olympic apparel. “They’ve already told us '
         'the new suits are warmer than the ones they’ve had in the past—and '
         'they’re pretty happy about it.”\n'
         'Under Armour’s designers used a different state-of-the-art fabric on '
         'the suit’s shoulders, upper arms and back to provide better '
         'aerodynamics. “It’s easy to think that since athletes are tucked '
         'away in their bobsleds, the aerodynamics of the suit is '
         'meaningless,” Cumiskey says. “But in bobsled, an event where every '
         'hundredth of a second matters, the race can be won or lost from the '
         'moment the athletes start pushing the sled, and anything that '
         'creates drag, including the suit, can slow them down. Even inside '
         'the sled, their shoulders and backs are exposed to the passing air.” '
         'Decreasing drag, Cumiskey says, could make the difference between '
         'being on the podium or not.\n'
         'To identify this more aerodynamic material, Cumiskey and others '
         'began testing new fabrics for the U.S. speed skating team in the '
         'wind tunnel at Specialized Bicycle Components in Morgan Hill, '
         'Calif., a couple of years ago. They did trials on mannequins that '
         'collectively wore 100 different fabrics. One candidate fabric, '
         'dubbed “H1,” was the clear winner. Made of nylon and spandex, it has '
         'a unique weave that helps reduce wind resistance. “What makes H1 so '
         'aerodynamically fast are the air channels—the spacing of the ridges '
         'and their depth—that are engineered into the fabric,” Cumiskey says. '
         'In addition, H1 has a barely perceptible jagged, shark skin–like '
         'texture when you run your hand over it in one direction. That '
         'sandpaper-like surface is enough to disturb the airflow over the '
         'athletes’ bodies, allowing it to wrap slightly around them. This '
         'phenomenon reduces drag by shrinking the size of their wakes, '
         'according to Cumiskey.\n'
         'Chris Yu, an aerospace engineer and director of integrated '
         'technologies at Specialized who led the team conducting the wind '
         'tunnel trials, was impressed with its performance, too. “At the end '
         'of the day H1 gives athletes less aerodynamic drag and faster speeds '
         'for the same amount of exertion,” he says. For Olympic competitors '
         'trying to eke every last nanosecond of speed out of their finely '
         'tuned bodies—and uniforms—tiny tweaks to their suits’ software may '
         'help them bring home the gold.\n',

 'text': 'The next chapter in cosmic exploration is starting to take shape: '
         'NASA engineers have proposed a space station that—if Congress '
         'approves its funding—would begin orbiting the moon in about a '
         'decade. A primary goal is to develop the infrastructure and '
         'experience to one day land humans on Mars.\n'
         'The Deep Space Gateway (DSG) project would likely be a collaboration '
         'among the U.S., Russia and other international partners. It would '
         'sit in a lunar orbit about 240,000 miles from Earth—1,000 times '
         'farther than the International Space Station (ISS). This would put '
         "it outside Earth's protective magnetic field, letting scientists "
         'measure the effects of deep-space radiation on humans and '
         'instruments. The station could also be a relay point for expeditions '
         "to the moon's surface. Plans for lunar landers—bearing humans or "
         'robots, or both—are still under discussion. NASA officials say '
         'astronauts and construction materials could be ferried to lunar '
         'orbit in four Orion rocket launches sometime after 2019.\n'
         'But the proposal has its critics. After the Columbia space shuttle '
         'disaster in 2003, NASA vowed to launch humans separately from '
         'cargo—a principle the DSG plan appears to violate. Some space policy '
         'experts warn that lunar operations are expensive and could be more '
         'of a distraction from Mars than a step toward it. Others question '
         'whether the month-long stays planned for the new station would teach '
         'NASA enough about how the human body responds to deep space, given '
         'that the journey to Mars requires at least six months. One lunar '
         'engineer has expressed concern about intermittent and unpredictable '
         'solar storms. Such events might subject astronauts to dangerous '
         'radiation levels in the absence of a shield, such as a thick layer '
         "of water, which would need to be built into the space station's "
         'design.\n'
         'Despite these reservations, many experts agree the moon could be a '
         'crucial training and proving ground—not just for astronauts but also '
         'for the Earth-based operations and equipment to support human '
         'spaceflight. “In my mind, it is clear you have to do the lunar '
         'exploration first,” says David Kring, a scientist at the Lunar and '
         'Planetary Institute in Houston, who has worked extensively on moon '
         'mission planning. Humans have not landed on the moon since the '
         '1970s. The current generation of spaceflight engineers needs to '
         'learn to work on an extraterrestrial surface, Kring says, “and the '
         'best place to do that is three days away.”\n',

         "booster\xa0Tuesday (Feb. 6) from the same Florida pad used by NASA's "
         'Apollo missions, the company claimed the title for the most powerful '
         'rocket. And for some companies, that might be a year-defining feat.\n'
         'But SpaceX and its CEO,\xa0Elon Musk, have a lot more coming this '
         'year, including launching astronauts on its crewed Dragon spacecraft '
         'and preparing its Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) for potential tests in '
         '2019.\n'
         "First, there's the Falcon Heavy, on which SpaceX spent nearly $500 "
         'million over seven years to enter the heavy-lift market for '
         'launching huge satellites and spacecraft off planet Earth. The '
         'rocket can carry twice as much payload as its closest competitor '

         'three first-stage boosters are designed to be reusable. For SpaceX, '
         "that's a launch vehicle triple threat.\xa0\n"
         '"Falcon Heavy opens up a new class of payload," Musk told reporters '
         'after Tuesday\'s launch. "It can launch twice as much payload as any '
         'other rocket in the world … It can launch things right to Pluto and '
         'beyond, no stop needed." [SpaceX\'s 1st Falcon Heavy Rocket Test '
         'Flight in Pictures]\n'
         "SpaceX's Falcon Heavy can launch up to 141,000 lbs. (64 metric tons) "
         "of payload into orbit, and sent Musk's Tesla Roadster\xa0on a "
         'deep-space ride toward the asteroid belt\xa0when the rocket blasted '
         "off from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, "
         'Florida, Tuesday. That lift capacity allows SpaceX to launch heavier '
         'satellites into low Earth orbit, or reach higher geostationary '
         'orbits used by some satellites to keep station over the same part of '
         'Earth.\n'
         'SpaceX advertises Falcon Heavy flights for $90 million a launch. The '
         'Delta IV Heavy, meanwhile, can launch 32 tons (29 metric tons) into '
         'orbit and costs between $300 million and $500 million per flight, '
         'according to Tommy Sanford, executive director of the Commercial '
         "Spaceflight Federation,\xa0told Space.com before the launch. That's "
         'a potentially huge cost savings.\n'
         'Musk told reporters this week that, given a successful test flight, '
         'the next Falcon Heavy could launch within three to six months. And '
         "make no mistake: Tuesday's launch was a successful flight.\n"
         "Only two events didn't go as planned: The center core of the "
         'three-booster first stage missed its drone-ship landing and crashed '
         "into the Atlantic Ocean, and a final engine burn of the rocket's "
         "second stage was stronger than expected, sending the Falcon Heavy's "
         "unique payload (Musk's Tesla Roadster and a mannequin named "
         '"Starman") into an orbit that extends out to the asteroid belt, '
         'beyond the orbit of Mars as initially planned.\n'
         'There are two more Falcon Heavy missions expected to fly in 2018: '
         'the launch of a beefy communications satellite called Arabsat 6A; '
         'and Space Test Program 2 for the U.S. Air Force, a flight that will '
         'also launch the LightSail 2 solar sail for The Planetary Society.\n'
         "SpaceX's flight manifest also includes future Falcon Heavy missions "
         'to launch satellites for the companies Inmarsat and Viasat.\n'
         'So, Musk expects that SpaceX will be flying a lot of Falcon Heavy '
         'rockets—enough to ensure the boosters will be certified to launch '
         'heavy satellites on national security missions for the U.S. '
         'military. SpaceX launched its\xa0first Falcon 9 missions for the '
         'military in 2017.\n'
         '"We have a number of commercial customers for Falcon Heavy," Musk '
         'said. "I really don\'t think it\'s going to be, in any way, an '
         'impediment to acceptance of national security missions."\n'
         "But remember, the Falcon Heavy isn't the end game for SpaceX and "
         'Musk in 2018. The company still plans to\xa0launch astronauts on its '
         'Falcon 9 and Dragon\xa0by the end of the year.\n'
         'SpaceX has been flying uncrewed cargo delivery missions to the '
         'International Space Station for NASA for years, and in 2014, the '
         'space agency picked the Hawthorne, California-based firm as\xa0one '
         'of two companies to fly American astronauts to the station. (The '
         'other company is Boeing, which will launch astronauts on its '
         'Starliner crew capsule using Atlas V rockets.)\n'
         '"We\'re making great progress on Crew Dragon," Musk said.\n'
         "Mission assurance for each SpaceX launch is the company's No. 1 "
         'priority, with Falcon Heavy a close second until recently, Musk '
         'said. But a month ago, the Crew Dragon program took over that second '
         'spot.\n'
         '"We\'re aspiring to fly crews to orbit at the end of this year," '
         'Musk said. "I think the hardware will be ready."\n'
         "In fact, the spacesuit worn by SpaceX's Starman on the Falcon Heavy "
         'flight is the same one astronauts will wear on Dragon, he said.\n'
         "And finally,\xa0there's the BFR: the ship Musk wants to use to "
         'colonize Mars.\n'
         "On paper, SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket looks like the megarocket to "
         "end all megarockets. It's a completely reusable launch system and "
         'features a massive spaceship on top of an equally massive booster '
         'powered by 31 SpaceX Raptor engines. (The Falcon Heavy uses 27 of '
         "the company's Merlin engines.) [The BFR: SpaceX's Mars-Colonization "
         'Architecture in Images]\n'
         'The combined rocket and spaceship will stand 348 feet (106 meters) '
         'and will be able to launch 150 tons (136 metric tons) to low Earth '
         "orbit (LEO), making the BFR more powerful than\xa0NASA's Saturn V "
         'moon rocket, which could launch 135 tons (122 metric tons) to LEO. '
         '(The Falcon Heavy may be the most powerful rocket in operation '
         'today, but it would take more than one to match the Saturn V, Musk '
         'said.)\n'
         'Each spaceship may carry up to 100 passengers, and the spacecraft on '
         'its own—without the booster—could potentially be used for\xa0'
         'superfast point-to-point travel around the Earth, Musk said last '
         'year when describing the system at the International Astronautical '
         'Congress in Adelaide, Australia.\n'
         'This week, Musk said work on the BFR—which he first unveiled to the '
         'world in 2016—has been going so well, the company no longer plans to '
         'use its brand-new Falcon Heavy rocket to launch astronauts on '
         'deep-space missions.\n'
         'Last year, Musk announced SpaceX would use the Falcon Heavy and a '
         'Crew Dragon capsule to\xa0launch two passengers on a trip around the '
         'moon. That mission, he said then, could potentially launch by the '
         'end of 2018. But now, SpaceX will likely not certify Falcon Heavy to '
         'carry astronauts as it has for Falcon 9, and will for the BFR.\n'
         'Simply put, the BFR is the better choice, Musk said.\n'
         '"The ship is capable of single-stage to orbit if we fully load the '
         'tanks," Musk said of the BFR\'s spaceship without its booster.\n'
         'That spaceship could be ready for short demonstration hops in 2019, '
         "Musk said. Those hops would be much like\xa0SpaceX's prototype "
         'Grasshopper rocket tests\xa0that led to the reusable Falcon 9 '
         'first-stage boosters the company relies on today.\n'
         'While SpaceX could try to do short hops of the BFR spaceship '
         "offshore, flying between its two drone-ship landing pads, it's more "
         "likely those tests will occur at\xa0the company's newest launch site "
         'in south Texas, near Brownsville.\n'
         '"It will most likely be at our Brownsville location because we\'ve '
         'got a lot of land if it blows up," Musk said.\n'
         'If the BFR test hops are a success, SpaceX would fly a series of '
         'ever-more-complex flights to prove out the system, he added.\n'
         '"I think it\'s conceivable that we do our first test flight in three '
         'or four years," Musk said. That one would send the full BFR system '
         'to low Earth orbit.\n'
         "So that's a big year for SpaceX, with potentially more big years to "
         "come. And it's all happening as the company continues its "
         'traditional Falcon 9 rocket launches for midsize satellite missions '
         'and NASA cargo deliveries to the International Space Station.\n'
         "The Falcon Heavy debut was SpaceX's third launch of 2018, following "
         'two Falcon 9 missions in January that\xa0launched the mysterious '
         'Zuma payload\xa0for the U.S. government and\xa0the GovSat-1 '

         '"What I find strange about this flight is that normally I feel super '
         'stressed out the day before; this time I don\'t," SpaceX CEO Elon '
         'Musk said in a news teleconference yesterday (Feb. 5). "That may be '

         'really hopeful for this flight going as planned."\n'
         "The rocket stands 230 feet (70 meters) tall and will be the world's "
         'most powerful operational rocket, able to lift payloads of up to '
         '119,000 lbs. (57 metric tons) into orbit. For this launch, though, '
         "the Falcon Heavy will have a smaller, stranger payload:\xa0Musk's "
         'car, a red Tesla Roadster. (Musk is also CEO of the electric car '
         'company Tesla.) The car is set to end up in an orbit around the sun '
         "that's far enough out to reach Mars, had the mission launched at the "
         'right time, and Musk said it will carry cameras that should provide '
         '"some epic views," if all goes well. [How SpaceX\'s Falcon Heavy '
         'Rocket Works (Infographic)]\n'
         'Musk\xa0has emphasized\xa0that this is a high-risk launch, setting '
         "expectations low for a successful maiden flight. The vehicle's 27 "
         'first-stage engines will all need to light at the right time, for '
         'instance, and the central first-stage will undergo a lot of stress '
         'during the launch. After Musk made that comment, the Falcon Heavy\xa0'
         'underwent a successful engine test-fire, in which all the '
         'first-stage engines ignited for about 10 seconds on the launch pad.\n'
         '"It\'d be a real huge downer if it blows up," Musk said during the '
         'teleconference. "If something goes wrong, hopefully it goes wrong '
         'far into the mission, so we at least learn as much as possible along '
         'the way … I would consider it a win if it just clears the pad and '
         'doesn\'t blow the pad to smithereens." Musk said that rebuilding the '
         'pad could take 8 to 12 months, which would be the limiting factor '
         'for when they could try another launch if this one went poorly; '
         'SpaceX can build another Falcon Heavy to test in 3 or 4 months.\n'
         'The Falcon Heavy will lift off from\xa0the same launch pad\xa0used '
         'by most of the Apollo moon missions, and it will have\xa0the most '
         "lift capacity\xa0of any U.S. spacecraft since Apollo's Saturn V. If "
         'successful, the Falcon Heavy will pave the way for SpaceX transport '
         'beyond a close Earth orbit—to the moon and onward to Mars.\n'
         '"We will have a good time no matter what happens," Musk said. "It '
         "should be exciting, one way or another—it's either going to be an "
         'exciting success or an exciting failure."\n'
         'Either way, he added, "It\'s going to be one big boom."\n'

         '“Nuclear power, like the boy next door, seems to have grown up '
         'overnight. That it has indeed come of age is incontrovertible. For '
         'two years running it has accounted for nearly half of all the new '
         'power-generating capacity ordered by U.S. utilities. That maturity '
         'came quickly is also incontrovertible. The first truly large-scale '
         'nuclear unit—a 428,000-kilowatt installation at San Onofre, '
         'Calif.—was licensed for construction as recently as February 24, '
         '1964, and announcements of commercial nuclear power projects did not '
         'begin to gain momentum until the fall of 1965; yet by the summer of '
         '1966 nuclear power had drawn abreast of fossil power in the utility '
         'marketplace. It is safe to say that no one, not even the most '
         'optimistic reactor manufacturer, expected so rapid or decisive a '
         'market breakthrough.”\n'
         'Auto Export Superpower\n'
         "“The United States is at present the world's market for motor cars "
         'and trucks. An agent for the U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic '
         'Commerce reports a prosperous condition of affairs prevailing in '
         'Japan, which is buying more automobiles, especially large cars, than '
         'ever before. There are about 2,400 automobiles in Japan at present, '
         '600 of which were imported during the first nine months of last '
         'year, as against 218 during all of 1916. Japanese roads are very '
         'narrow and the bridges weak, but the Government is spending '
         '$2,000,000 on the road from Tokio to Yokohama, and has ordered the '
         'provinces to improve their roads and bridges.”\n'
         'High Heels\n'
         '“Unfortunately the fashion which calls for ever higher heels is as '
         'unhygienic as it is unesthetic. By means of the motion picture '
         'camera Dr. Édouard Quénu has been able to analyze the constrained '
         'gait which results from a heel three inches or more in height. In '
         'the film, the subject passes before us in short, jerky steps, moving '
         'her foot through the air and putting it on and off the ground quite '
         'rigidly, without change of relative position of heel and toe, giving '
         'the effect of a stiff and awkward glide rather than a step. It is '
         'the jerky progress of an automatic puppet which we have here, not '
         'the supple gait worthy of a brisk human being.”\n'
         'War Balloons\n'
         '“The French navy is employing a number of kite balloons with tenders '
         'for the purpose of spotting German U-boats lurking near the coast '
         'and at the entrances of important harbors. The life of a kite '
         'observer at sea is full of thrills, especially during those times '
         'when he climbs up to the balloon swinging above the trawler [see '
         'illustration]. It is said of these kite observers that some of their '
         'feats in this connection would compare most favorably with those of '
         'a trained tight-rope walker.”\n'

         'Alfred Nobel, of Hamburg, writing to the London Times relative to '
         'the same Newcastle accident, bitterly complains that the '
         'introduction of this valuable explosive, owing to the accidents '
         'resulting from gross carelessness, has been systematically opposed. '
         'The Newcastle explosion, it seems clear, was caused by the grossest '
         'violation of the printed instructions. The cans containing the '
         'nitro-glycerin were opened with blows of a spade, and then thrown '
         'into a hole one upon another. From the shock thus occasioned the '
         'explosion took place.”\n'

         'regarded as only a place to eat, drink, and sleep in, the work is '
         'begun that ends in gambling houses and reckless degradation. Young '
         'people must have fun and relaxation somewhere; if they do not find '

         'require an attached electronic device.\n'
         'To eliminate the need for such peripheral gear, researchers at the '
         'University of Washington recently took advantage of what they say is '
         'a previously untapped property of conductive thread: its ability to '
         'be magnetized. Using magnetic instead of electric properties of the '

         'they say is unique among wearables: turn them into storage devices.\n'
         'The Washington team magnetized a patch of fabric embroidered with '
         'conductive thread, giving different parts of the cloth a north or '
         "south orientation that corresponded to binary 1's or 0's. This step "
         'allowed the researchers to store up to 33 million different '

         'of the Association for Computing Machinery.\n'
         'The garments still stored data after washing, drying and ironing, '
         "but they could not escape time's eraser; after about a week, the "
         "threads' magnetic fields had weakened by around 30 percent. The "
         'researchers suggest that using custom-made thread designed to hold '
         'stronger magnetic fields might work longer. But for now the clothes '
         'may be best suited for storing temporary codes, such as those found '

         'Bobsled and Skeleton events in the next few days at the PyeongChang '
         'Winter Olympics. That team joins Jamaica’s women bobsledders—also '

         'Jamaican men’s team of Cool Runnings fame competed at the 1998 '
         'Winter Games)—and a handful of other competitors who hail from '
         'places where it rarely, if ever, gets cold enough to snow.\n'
         'Not surprisingly, the favorites to medal in those events—including '
         'Canada, Germany and the U.S.—all benefit from frosty winter months '
         'conducive to cultivating ice-sport athletes from a young age. '
         'Further evidence of the Winter Games’ inherent bias toward athletes '
         'native to cold climes: Team Nigeria bobsled driver Seun Adigun '
         'actually grew up just outside of Chicago and Akuoma Omeoga (one of '
         'the two brakewomen) is from Minnesota.\n'
         'Scientists and sports enthusiasts alike have long been looking to '
         'level this frigid playing field via the development of plastics that '
         'can serve as synthetic ice to line backyard hockey and ice-skating '
         'rinks. But the type of polymer needed to coat a sloping '
         'two-kilometer track—one that can accommodate sleds traveling in '
         'excess of 125 kilometers per hour—has proved much more elusive. “Any '
         'synthetic track needs to offer a similar sliding and driving '
         'experience to ice and not create any concerns about athlete safety,” '
         'says Jan-Anders Månsson, director of Purdue University’s Composites '
         'Manufacturing and Simulation Center and a professor in materials and '
         'chemical engineering. “It also needs to be both durable and '
         'cost-effective.”\n'
         'Månsson has spent the past several years investigating how a type of '
         'high-density plastic called “ultrahigh-molecular-weight” '
         'polyethylene could be used to replace ice as the track lining for '
         'Olympic sled sports, including bobsled, luge and skeleton. Such '
         'plastics are currently used as protective coatings for a variety of '
         'objects—including artificial joints and other biomedical devices as '
         'well as dump truck beds—to protect them from abrasions. The material '
         'is a variation on the polyethylene used to make shopping bags, and '
         'gets its strength from its structure of extremely long, overlapping '
         'chains of molecules. These chains all align in the same direction, '
         'enabling the material to better transfer heavy loads placed on it, '
         'says Susan Selke, director of Michigan State University’s School of '
         'Packaging. “In general, the higher the molecular weight—or mass—the '
         'stronger and more scratch-resistant the plastic is,” Selke says. One '
         'of the challenges to working with such a material is its high '
         'viscosity, or resistance to flow, which means it must be processed '
         'at higher temperatures in order to be made to take a particular '
         'shape, she adds.\n'
         'A synthetic track misted with water could in theory almost mimic the '
         'friction level that the stainless-steel runners of bobsleds, luge '
         'sleds and skeleton sleds encounter on actual ice, according to '
         'Månsson (who is a former president of the International Academy of '
         'Sports Science and Technology, an International Olympic Committee). '
         'Such a pathway would also have nearly the same speed profile as an '
         'ice track, allowing the sleds to reach more than 100 kilometers per '
         'hour within the first 600 meters, Månsson says. “A good ice driver '
         'would be good on this surface, too,” he adds. “We don’t want to '
         'create a new sport and new athletes.”\n'
         'The main problem with long, ice-lined tracks is they are expensive '
         'to build and maintain—a major reason why only 16 of them exist '
         'worldwide. The reinforced concrete bobsled track built for the 2006 '
         'Turin Olympics, for example, cost about $100 million to build and '
         'another $1 million annually to maintain due to the refrigeration '
         'system required to cool its surface. Bobsled has been part of the '
         'Olympics since the first Winter Games in 1924. (The only exception '
         'was the 1960 games in Squaw Valley, Calif., when the organizing '
         'committee decided not to build a track in order to cut costs.) Such '
         'tracks host very few competitions each year and, in some cases, are '
         'not used at all following the Olympics.\n'
         'A plastic track would cost about $5 million to build and could be '
         'cost-effectively maintained for year-round use—even in warmer '
         'locations—Månsson says. Such accessibility is crucial to cultivating '
         'future generations of winter sled-sport athletes, particularly as '
         'those more traditional sports compete with snowboarding and other X '
         'Games events for young athletes’ attention, he says.\n'
         'As much as plastic tracks might help attract attention to sled '
         'sports in more tropical locales, the path to building a prototype '
         'has been anything but smooth. Månsson completed a feasibility study '
         'in 2015. But his efforts to secure the roughly $300,000 in funding '
         'needed to build a 200-meter test track at the École Polytechnique '
         'Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, where he began his research, '
         'were interrupted by his move to Purdue in September 2016. Månsson’s '
         'study aside, there are a lot of questions about how to actually '
         'build such a track. It would most likely have to be constructed '
         'using two- to three-meter lengths of plastic joined by a flexible '
         'material, which could accommodate the plastic pieces’ shrinkage in '
         'the cold and expansion in the heat. Månsson had originally targeted '
         'the 2020 Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne as the inaugural venue for '
         'a full-length plastic track, but those plans were shelved without a '
         'sample track to show officials.\n'
         'Until those kinks are worked out and the power of plastic is proved, '
         'it is likely countries currently dominating sled sports will '
         'continue to do so.\n'

         'ensure new technologies are safe and effective for public use: The '
         'testing system for new medications. The basic approach involves '
         'ensuring these systems do what they’re intended to, without any '
         'serious negative side effects—even if researchers don’t fully '
         'understand how they work.\n'
         'Self-driving cars\xa0are expected\xa0to\xa0improve road safety,\xa0'
         'freeing up drivers’ time and attention\xa0and\xa0transforming '
         'cities\xa0and even societies.\n'
         'The regulations that are created for self-driving cars will have '
         'massive effects that\xa0ripple throughout the economy and society. '
         'The rules are likely to come from some combination of the two '
         'current automotive regulators, the federal\xa0National Highway '
         'Traffic Safety Administration\xa0and\xa0state departments of '
         'transportation.\n'
         'Federal rules focus primarily on safety standards for structural, '
         'mechanical and electrical components of the vehicles, like airbags '
         'and seat belts. States can enforce their own safety rules—for '
         'example, regulating emissions and handling driver licensing and '
         'vehicle registration, which often also includes requiring insurance '
         'coverage.\n'
         'Today’s state and federal rules treat drivers and cars as separate '
         'entities. But self-driving cars, by definition, combine the two. '
         'Without consistency between those regulations, confusion will '
         'reign.\n'
         'The Obama administration came up with\xa0116 pages of regulations\xa0'
         'with lots of details, but little understanding of how self-driving '
         'cars worked. For example, they called for each car to have '
         'human-readable permanent labels listing its specific self-driving '
         'capabilities, including limits on speeds, specific highways and '
         'weather conditions, all of which would be extremely confusing for '
         'users. The regulations also called for ethical decisions to be made '
         '“consciously and intentionally”—which is\xa0questionable, if not '
         'impossible, for a machine.\n'
         'The Trump administration pared down the rules to\xa026 pages, but '
         'have not yet addressed the important issue of testing self-driving '
         'cars.\n'
         'Testing algorithms is very like testing medications. In both cases, '
         'researchers can’t always tell exactly why something works '
         '(especially in the case of\xa0machine learning\xa0algorithms), but '
         'it is nevertheless possible to evaluate the outcome: Does a sick '
         'person get well after taking a medication?\n'
         'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xa0requires medicines be '
         'tested\xa0not for their mechanisms of treatment, but for the '
         'results. The two main criteria are effectiveness—how well the '
         'medicine treats the condition it’s intended to—and safety—how severe '
         'any side effects or other problems are. With this method, it’s '
         'possible to prove a medication is safe and effective without knowing '
         'how it works.\n'
         'Similarly, federal regulations could—and should—require testing for '
         'self-driving cars’ algorithms. To date, governments have tested cars '
         'as machines, ensuring steering, brakes and other functions work '
         'properly. Of course, there are also government tests for human '
         'drivers.\n'
         'A machine that does both should have to pass both types of '
         'tests—particularly for\xa0vehicles that don’t allow for human '
         'drivers.\n'
         'In my view, before allowing any specific self-driving car on the '
         'road, NHTSA should require test results from the car and its driving '
         'algorithms to demonstrate they are safe and reliable. The closest '
         'standard at the moment is\xa0California’s requirement\xa0that all '
         'manufacturers of self-driving cars submit annual reports of how many '
         'times a human driver had to take control of its vehicles when the '
         'algorithms failed to function properly.\n'
         'That’s a good first step, but it doesn’t tell regulators or the '
         'public anything about what the vehicles were doing or what was '
         'happening around them when the humans took over. Tests should '
         'examine what the algorithms direct the car to do on freeways with '
         'trucks, and in neighborhoods with animals, kids, pedestrians and '
         'cyclists. Testing should also look at what the algorithms do when '
         'both vehicle performances and sensors’ input is compromised by rain, '
         'snow or other weather conditions. Cars should run through scenarios '
         'with temporary construction zones, four-way intersections, wrong-way '
         'vehicles and police officers giving directions that contradict '
         'traffic lights and other situations.\n'
         'Human driving tests include some evaluations of a driver’s judgment '
         'and decision-making, but tests for self-driving cars should be more '
         'rigorous because there’s no way to rely on human-centered concepts '
         'like instinct, reflex or self-preservation. Any action a machine '
         'takes is a choice, and the public should be clear on how likely it '
         'is that those choices will be safe ones.\n'
         'Self-driving cars’ algorithms constantly calculate probabilities. '
         'How likely is it that a particular shape is a person? How likely is '
         'it that the sensor data means the person is walking toward the road? '
         'How likely is it that the person will step into the street? How '
         'likely is it that the car can stop before hitting her? This is in '
         'fact\xa0similar to how the human brain\xa0works.\n'
         'That presents a straightforward opportunity for testing autonomous '
         'cars and any software updates a manufacturer might distribute to '
         'vehicles already on the road: They could present human test drivers '
         'and self-driving algorithms with the same scenarios and monitor '
         'their performance over many trials. Any self-driving car that does '
         'as well as, or better than, people, can be certified as safe for the '
         'road. This is very much like the method used in drug testing, in '
         'which a new medication’s performance is rated against existing '
         'therapies and methods known to be ineffective, like the typical\xa0'
         'placebo sugar pill.\n'
         'Companies should be free to test any innovations they want on their '
         'closed tracks, and even on public roads with human safety drivers '
         'ready to take the wheel. But before self-driving cars become regular '
         'products available for anyone to purchase, the public should be '
         'shown clear proof of their safety, reliability and effectiveness.\n'

         '“transit” method (as opposed to these techniques) to find planets, '
         'looking for worlds in silhouette as they pass in front of their '
         'parent stars relative to the telescopes’ lines of sight. Kepler not '
         'only established transits as the dominant planet-hunting technique, '
         'it also stunningly revealed our galaxy brims with planets, '
         'particularly worlds two to four times the size of Earth.\n'
         'During its initial mission, Kepler scouted stars more than a '
         'thousand light-years away in a patch of sky within the '
         'constellations Cygnus, Lyra and Draco. So far, scientists have '
         'confirmed 2,341 exoplanets circling stars in Kepler’s original pool '
         'of some 170,000 targets. Another 4,496 candidate planets are '
         'pending, but many may never be confirmed because their stellar hosts '
         'are too dim to be easily observed by ground-based telescopes for '
         'necessary follow-up studies.\n'
         'The TESS team took the opposite approach, starting with what ground '
         'observations would be needed to follow-up and confirm candidate '
         'transiting Earth-like planets, and then deciding on specific targets '
         'for the telescope. They selected about 200,000 stars for study '
         'during TESS’s two-year primary mission. Each of those target stars '
         'already has been plotted in detail by the European Space Agency’s '
         'ongoing Gaia space telescope, which is creating the best-yet all-sky '
         'catalogue of stellar positions and distances.\n'
         'Most of TESS’s targets are within 300 light-years from Earth, '
         'significantly closer and up to a hundred times brighter than most of '
         'the stars studied by Kepler. “On TESS, we will be able to do '
         'ground-based follow-up on all of them. It will just be a matter of '
         'priorities, not abilities,” says project scientist Stephen Rinehart, '
         'with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.\n'
         'The transit technique pioneered by Kepler and planned for TESS '
         'reveals the size of a planet relative to its host star. If several '
         'transits can be observed, scientists also can determine how far from '
         'the star a planet orbits—information that can then be used to '
         'estimate its temperature and whether it could support liquid water '
         'on its surface, a key consideration for habitability.\n'
         'But to assess a planet’s mass—which is needed to determine whether '
         'it is dense with metal and rock like Earth or instead composed of '
         'ice or gas—astronomers usually turn to ground-based telescopes. '
         'Often only a relatively modest observatory, it turns out, is needed '
         'to look for wobbles in a star’s spin caused by the slight but '
         'regular gravitational tugging of its orbiting planetary brood. The '
         'TESS project is enlisting dozens of astronomers and reserving time '
         'on several ground-based telescopes for such studies.\n'
         'The hunt for neighboring Earth-like planets begins about two months '
         'after TESS’s launch, which is currently slated for mid-April. That’s '
         'when the telescope should arrive in an unusual operational orbit '
         'that loops high around Earth, passing only as close as about 67,300 '
         'miles before zooming out to nearly the orbit of the moon some '
         '234,000 miles away. When TESS is at the highest point of its orbit '
         'with respect to Earth, the moon will be 90 degrees to the left or '
         'right, serving as an orbital ballast that will keep the telescope '
         'gravitationally steady for decades without the use of steering '
         'thrusters.\n'
         'This eccentric orbit allows TESS to spend most of its time in deep, '
         'dark space, with minimal interference from sunshine and the light '
         'reflecting off Earth and the moon. The spacecraft will swing around '
         'the planet every 13.7 days, orbiting exactly twice as fast as the '
         'moon. When TESS is closest to Earth it will suspend observations for '
         '10 hours to transmit stored science data to one of NASA’s three Deep '
         'Space Network ground stations. Those transmissions will occur on '
         'high-rate, Ka-band frequencies—a first for the network that will '
         'pave the way for other data-intensive future space missions, '
         'including the James Webb Space Telescope.\n'
         'TESS’s data will not only include measurements of each target star’s '
         'brightness taken every two minutes, but also a full-sky image taken '
         'every half-hour capturing more than 20 million stars and 10 million '
         'galaxies. “It’s just going to be this treasure trove of data. We '
         'expect that that archive will be mined for years,” says NASA '
         'astronomer Patricia Boyd, who leads Goddard’s TESS Guest '
         'Investigator Program.\n'
         'The telescope is outfitted with four cameras positioned to cover a '
         'wedge of sky 24 degrees across and 96 degrees long, the equivalent '
         'of about 10,000 full moons. Shifting its field of view every two '
         'orbits, TESS will cover the sky’s entire southern hemisphere during '
         'the first year of operation and then flip to cover its northern '
         'hemisphere in the second year. In all, TESS will cover 90 percent of '
         'the sky, an area about 400 times larger than what Kepler observed.\n'
         'Of key interest are the stars around the ecliptic poles, which will '
         'be included in each slice of the sky covered by TESS. These are the '
         'stars directly above and below the ecliptic plane, in which the '
         'planets move around the sun. Worlds in these regions will become '
         'primary targets for follow-up studies by the James Webb Space '
         'Telescope, which, among its many other tasks, will attempt to ferret '
         'out the atmospheric chemistry for some transiting exoplanets. Webb '
         'is slated to launch in 2019. “In that role TESS serves as a finder '
         'scope for Webb. We’re finding the particular star that actually '
         'potentially hosts an exoplanet around it,” says TESS lead scientist '
         'George Ricker, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n'
         'Ricker adds that “it shouldn’t be hard” to meet the TESS mission '
         'goal to measure the mass of 50 small planets. Simulations forecast '
         'that by the end of the initial three-year ground observation '
         'program, the team should have verified more like 500 small planets, '
         'not 50, he says.\n'
         'Ultimately, TESS could contribute as many as 20,000 new planets to '
         'the exoplanet catalogue, most of which will be circling M-dwarf '
         'stars that are one quarter to one half the diameter of the sun and '
         'much dimmer and cooler. M-dwarfs, which comprise about 70 percent of '
         'stars in the Milky Way, are TESS’s primary targets.\n'
         '“To me the most exciting thing about any new mission is the thing '
         'you don’t expect,” says Rinehart, the project scientist. “I really '
         'hope that somewhere along the line we find something bizarre, '
         'something that we can’t explain that requires us to really think '
         'hard about what it is we’re seeing. I think we will, but I have no '
         'idea what it will be.”\n',

         'solution of salt and water, but researchers hope that future '
         'versions might get their energy from bodily fluids. \xa0\n'
         '“Our artificial electric organ has a lot of characteristics that '
         "traditional batteries don't have,” says Thomas Schroeder, a chemical "
         'engineer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who co-led the '
         'research. As well as its desirable physical features, “it isn’t as '
         'potentially toxic, and it runs on potentially renewable streams of '
         'electrolyte solution”.\n'
         'To design a biocompatible power source, Schroeder and his colleagues '
         'took inspiration from the knifefish, or electric eel (Electrophorus '
         'electricus), which defends itself and stuns prey with electrical '
         'discharges of up to 600 volts. The eel generates these powerful '
         'shocks using specialized cells called electrocytes, in organs that '
         'run along most of the length of its body. Variations in the '
         'concentration of electrolytes inside these cells generate a flow of '
         'ions that carries electric charge. Although each individual cell '
         'produces only a small voltage, eels have thousands of them stacked '
         'in series, so that all the voltages are added together.\xa0\n'
         'Schroeder’s team mimicked the anatomy of electrocytes using four '
         'different hydrogels made of polyacrylamide and water, then stacked '
         'around 2,500 of these units together. This synthetic system '
         'generated a potential difference of 110 volts. But its total power '
         'output was between two and three orders of magnitude smaller than '
         'that achieved by an electric eel, whose cells are thinner and thus '
         'lower-resistance.\n'
         'In theory, the power generated by the artificial battery could be '
         'enough to run existing ultra-low-power devices, including some '
         'cardiac pacemakers, says Schroeder. But the team thinks it should be '
         'possible to improve the system’s performance dramatically, for '
         'example by making the hydrogel membranes thinner to reduce their '
         'resistance. \xa0\n'
         'Electric eels use metabolic energy to sustain differences in '
         'electrolyte concentration between electrocytes. Schroeder hopes '
         "eventually to mimic that ability, too. “It's conceivable that we "
         'might someday be able to use a scheme like our artificial electric '
         'organ to tap into different fluids in the body,” he says.\n'
         'Markus Buehler, a materials scientist and engineer at the '
         'Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, is impressed by '
         'the team’s design. It is “an exciting advance that transcends '
         'conventional thinking”, he says. “I anticipate the deployment of '
         'this technology in the near future.”\n'

 'text': 'A first-of-its-kind gene therapy received approval from the Food and '
         'Drug Administration on Tuesday to treat a rare, inherited form of '
         'childhood blindness.\n'
         'The FDA marketing clearance of Spark Therapeutics’s\xa0Luxturna\xa0'
         'is historic for scientific and financial reasons. Luxturna is the '
         'first gene therapy approved in the U.S. that targets a disease '
         'caused by mutations in a specific gene.\n'
         'A Spark spokesman said the company will not disclose the Luxturna '
         'price tag until early January. Wall Street analysts expect the gene '
         'therapy to command a $1 million price tag—another first, but not '
         'necessarily a welcome one. At a time when drug prices are coming '
         'under intense scrutiny, Spark will need to convince insurers, '
         'politicians, and pharma critics that the benefit to patients offered '
         'by Luxturna justifies its high cost.\n'
         'The Institute for Clinical and Econonic Review (ICER), an '
         'influential non-profit that studies the cost effectiveness of new '
         'drugs, is holding a\xa0meeting to review Luxturna\xa0on Jan. 25.\n'
         '“Today’s approval marks another first in the field of gene '
         'therapy—both in how the therapy works and in expanding the use of '
         'gene therapy beyond the treatment of cancer to the treatment of '

         'breakthrough approach in treating a wide-range of challenging '
         'diseases,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.\n'
         'Like other gene therapies, Luxturna inserts a functional piece of '

         'RPE65. People born with mutated RPE65 genes suffer from severe '
         'vision problems, including night blindness. As the disease '

         'become totally blind.\n'

         'the genetically engineered “CAR” cells on only two monkeys as well '
         'as on cells growing in lab dishes—it suggests that after 30 years of '
         'fruitless efforts to come up with an AIDS vaccine there might be a '
         'wholly new way to get the immune system to fight HIV infection.\n'
         '“The demonstration here that stem cells can be engineered to respond '
         'to AIDS virus-infected cells in an animal model is an impressive '
         'first step for harnessing the immune system to target HIV,” said Dr. '
         'Bruce Walker, director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and '
         'Harvard, who in the 1990s did pioneering research on the genetic '
         'engineering of immune cells to fight HIV and was not involved in the '
         'new study. “The effect at this point is modest, but clearly gives us '
         'something to build on.”\n'
         'To engineer T cells to fight cancer, scientists give them genes that '
         'produce surface molecules (the eponymous chimeric antigen receptors, '
         'or CARs) able to recognize and attach to their counterparts '
         '(antigens) on tumor cells. That antigen-receptor docking activates '
         'the CAR-T cells, causing them to kill tumor cells.\n'
         'To create T cells able to fight HIV, scientists genetically '
         'engineered not T cells themselves but stem cells that produce both T '
         'cells and other blood cells. The genetic engineering gave the '
         '“hematopoietic stem cells” and all of their descendants an '
         'HIV-specific CAR: one part of the CAR (called CD4) hunts down and '
         'binds the AIDS-causing virus, while an additional surface molecule '
         '(called C46) interferes with HIV’s ability to enter a T cell. That '
         'allowed T cells to detect viruses without themselves getting '
         'infected. It also let them find and destroy HIV-infected cells, '
         'which have some of the same T-cell-attracting surface molecules as '
         'HIV itself.\n'
         'The engineered T cells not only destroyed HIV-infected cells in both '
         'lab dishes and macaques—they also persisted for more than two years. '
         'That suggests that they can “provide long-lasting HIV-killing,” said '
         'immunologist Scott Kitchen of the David Geffen School of Medicine at '
         'UCLA, who led the study published in PLOS Pathogens. “We think the '
         'stem cell approach has greater potential to suppress HIV long-term '
         'and even eradicate the virus.”\n'
         'A clinical trial could begin in a couple of years, said Kitchen, who '
         'has been in talks with the private gene therapy company Calimmune '
         'and others about developing the approach.\n'
         'Lots of barriers stand between the promising preliminary results and '
         'a real-world HIV treatment, however.\n'
         'For one thing, CAR-T therapy for cancer is priced at nearly '
         '$500,000. Anything close to that for HIV treatment is a non-starter '
         'in most of the world, especially in poorer countries which have the '
         'majority of HIV/AIDS cases; some 17 million of the\xa036.7 million '
         'people\xa0living with HIV/AIDS aren’t even receiving the relatively '
         'cheap antiretroviral therapy that has saved million of lives.\n'
         'Price “is the main issue here,” Walker cautioned. “The only real '
         'viable role for this kind of therapy would be if it can eliminate '
         'the viral reservoir and cure infection, which has not been addressed '
         'in this paper. The price tag then could possibly be justified in '
         'that case, but given that one can lead a relatively normal life with '
         'one pill once a day, it is hard to see how CAR-T cell therapy could '
         'be justified just to replace” today’s cheap pills.\n'
         'Engineered stem cells “would initially be an expensive approach, but '
         'would hopefully save the necessity and expense of being on '
         'antiretroviral therapy for a lifetime,” Kitchen said. He and his '
         'colleagues are working on delivering the engineered cells like a '
         'vaccine, perhaps making it affordable.\n'
         'Another reason for caution is that CAR-T’s against HIV have failed '
         'before. The basic idea of engineering immune cells to thwart HIV '
         'dates back at least to 1997, when researchers led by Walker\xa0'
         'showed\xa0that a forerunner of CAR-T’s could destroy HIV in lab '
         'dishes. But when scientists tested the approach in a small number of '
         'patients, the results were\xa0disappointing. “They really didn’t do '
         'anything,” said Kitchen.\n'
         'That was probably because HIV killed the CAR-Ts before the CAR-Ts '
         'could kill the virus.\n'
         'Creating CAR stem cells, rather than CAR-T’s, might get around that: '
         'engineered stem cells would produce “an endless supply of engineered '
         'T cells that continuously attack HIV,” Kitchen said, much like an '
         'army with an infinite number of replacement soldiers.\n'
         'That’s what happened in his macaques. Two received genetically '
         'engineered stem cells; two others served as controls. The stem cells '
         'burrowed into the bone marrow and produced HIV-killing CAR-T’s for '
         'the two years the macaques were studied. The animals experienced no '
         'adverse effects, and the CAR-T’s killed infected cells. They did '
         'only a so-so job of reducing the number of viruses in the animals.\n'
         'On the other hand, the killer cells went to sites where HIV tends to '
         'replicate and persist at the highest rates, including the lymph '
         'system and gastrointestinal tract. Walker called that “impressive,” '
         'since it raises the possibility that CAR-Ts might eradicate HIV from '
         'where it hides in the body.\n'

         'see them as indicators of a person’s health. The technology giant is '
         'using deep learning to predict a person’s blood pressure, age and '
         'smoking status by analysing a photograph of their retina. Google’s '
         'computers glean clues from the arrangement of blood vessels—and a '
         'preliminary study suggests that the machines can use this '
         'information to predict whether someone is at risk of an impending '
         'heart attack. \xa0\n'
         'The research relied on a convolutional neural network, a type of '
         'deep-learning algorithm that is transforming how biologists analyse '
         'images. Scientists are using the approach to find mutations in '
         'genomes and predict variations in the layout of single cells. '
         'Google’s approach, described in a preprint in August (R. Poplin\xa0'
         'et\xa0al.\xa0Preprint at\xa0https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09843; 2017), '
         'is part of a wave of new deep-learning applications that are making '
         'image processing easier and more versatile—and could even identify '
         'overlooked biological phenomena.\xa0\n'
         '“It was unrealistic to apply machine learning to many areas of '
         'biology before,” says Philip Nelson, a director of engineering at '
         'Google Research in Mountain View, California. “Now you can—but even '
         'more exciting, machines can now see things that humans might not '
         'have seen before.”\n'
         'Convolutional neural networks allow computers to process an image '
         'efficiently and holistically, without splitting it into parts. The '
         'approach took off in the tech sector around 2012, enabled by '
         'advances in computer power and storage; for example, Facebook uses '
         'this type of deep learning to identify faces in photo-graphs. But '
         'scientists struggled to apply the networks to biology, in part '
         'because of cultural differences between fields. “Take a group of '
         'smart biologists and put them in a room of smart computer scientists '
         'and they will talk two different languages to each other, and have '
         'different mindsets,” says Daphne Koller, chief computing officer at '
         'Calico—a biotechnology company in San Francisco, California, that is '
         'backed by Google’s parent, Alphabet.\xa0\n'
         'Scientists also had to identify which types of study could be '
         'conducted using networks that must be trained with huge sets of '
         'images before they can start making predictions. When Google wanted '
         'to use deep learning to find mutations in genomes, its scientists '
         'had to convert strands of DNA letters into images that computers '
         'could recognize. Then they trained their network on DNA snippets '
         'that had been aligned with a reference genome, and whose mutations '
         'were known. The end result was DeepVariant, a tool released in '
         'December that can find small variations in DNA sequences. In tests, '
         'DeepVariant performed at least as well as conventional tools.\n'
         'Cell biologists at the Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle, '
         'Washington, are using convolutional neural networks to convert flat, '
         'grey images of cells captured with light microscopes into 3D images '
         'in which some of a cell’s organelles are labelled in colour. The '
         'approach eliminates the need to stain cells—a process that requires '
         'more time and a sophisticated lab, and can damage the cell. Last '
         'month, the group published details of an advanced technique that can '
         'predict the shape and location of even more cell parts using just a '
         'few pieces of data—such as the cell’s outline\xa0(G. R. Johnson\xa0'
         'et al.\xa0Preprint at bioRxiv\xa0http://doi.org/chwv; 2017).\xa0\n'
         '“What you’re seeing now is an unprecedented shift in how well '
         'machine learning can accomplish biological tasks that have to do '
         'with imaging,” says Anne Carpenter, director of the Imaging Platform '
         'at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, '
         'Massachusetts. In 2015, her interdisciplinary team began to process '
         'cell images using convolutional neural networks; now, Carpenter '
         'says, the networks process about 15% of image data at her centre. '
         'She predicts that the approach will become the centre’s main mode of '
         'processing in a few years.\xa0\n'
         'Others are most excited by the idea that analysing images with '
         'convolutional neural networks could inadvertently reveal subtle '
         'biological phenomena, prompting biologists to ask questions they '
         'might not have considered before. “The most interesting phrase in '
         'science isn’t ‘Eureka!’, but ‘That’s weird—what’s going on?’” Nelson '
         'says.\n'
         'Such serendipitous discoveries could help to advance disease '
         'research, says Rick Horwitz, the Allen Institute’s executive '
         'director. If deep learning can reveal subtle markers of cancer in an '
         'individual cell, he says, it could help to improve how researchers '
         'classify tumour progression. That could in turn trigger new '
         'hypotheses about how cancer spreads.\n'
         'Other machine-learning connoisseurs in biology have set their sights '
         'on new frontiers, now that convolutional neural networks are taking '
         'flight for image processing. “Imaging is important, but so is '
         'chemistry and molecular data,” says Alex Wolf, a computational '
         'biologist at the German Research Center for Environmental Health in '
         'Neuherberg. Wolf hopes to tweak neural networks so that they can '
         'analyse gene expression. “I think there will be a very big '
         'breakthrough in the next few years,” he says, “that allows '
         'biologists to apply neural networks much more broadly.”\n'

 'name': 'Resistance to Common Germs Poses a Hurdle to New Gene Therapies',
 'text': 'A popular method of editing genes in research labs could trigger an '
         'immune reaction when used in people, according to a new study, which '
         'has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. But it is too '
         'soon to know how serious a problem this could pose for gene therapy, '
         'which aims to stop diseases caused by defective genes.\n'
         '“The big question will be: What impact does it actually have '
         'therapeutically?” says Amy Wagers, a stem cell biologist at Harvard '
         'University and the Joslin Diabetes Center, who was not involved in '
         'the study. In mice, she says, the gene-editing tool triggers an '
         'immune response, but is still safe and effective. No one knows what '
         'will happen in people. “It’s something that needs to be '
         'investigated,” she says.\n'
         'The CRISPR–Cas9 system, which functions as a genetic scissors and '
         'tape for editing DNA, is generally derived from either '
         'Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Most '
         'people have been exposed to staph or strep by the time they reach '
         'adulthood, which their bodies are likely to remember and may mount '
         'an immune attack when reexposed to them, says Matt Porteus, a '
         'pediatrician and stem cell scientist at Stanford University who led '
         'the research, which was posted to the preprint server bioRxiv last '
         'week.\n'
         'This prior exposure could potentially render the gene editing '
         'ineffective, with the body quickly eliminating all the CRISPR–Cas9 '
         'proteins. Or worse, it could trigger the kind of immune storm that '
         'killed a young gene therapy patient named Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, '
         'derailing the field for more than a decade. “We share everyone’s '
         'excitement about doing Cas9 genome editing, but we want to make sure '
         'we have learned from what happened in the gene therapy world and not '
         'ignore the possibility that this could become a problem,” Porteus '
         'says. “As we’re all thinking about developing Cas9-based '
         'therapeutics, we should think carefully about this potential '
         'problem.”\n'
         'CRISPR–Cas9, a tool adapted from bacteria, has become the darling of '
         'the biomedical community since an explosion of research in 2013. '
         'CRISPR, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short '
         'palindromic repeats, can be programmed to find specific stretches of '
         'genetic code. Then, the Cas9 enzyme attaches to the targeted DNA and '
         'cuts it, shutting off the gene.\n'
         'There are several other approaches to gene editing that predate '
         'CRISPR, including so-called zinc finger nucleases and TALENs '
         '(transcription activator-like effector nucleases). But each has '
         'challenges that have made CRISPR the favorite in research labs—and, '
         'many hoped, in people.\n'
         'The new study suggests it may take longer to make CRISPR gene '
         'editing safe to use in patients. But the problem is not '
         'insurmountable, bioengineer Feng Zhang, who helped develop the '
         'technology, wrote in an e-mail. “There are many open questions about '
         'the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based therapeutics,” wrote Zhang, '
         'a core member of the Broad Institute and a Massachusetts Institute '
         'of Technology professor. “Currently a number of different strategies '
         'are being pursued to develop Cas9 as a therapeutic…and each design '
         'requires a unique consideration of safety and efficacy,” Zhang '
         'added. “As these designs enter advanced stages of preclinical '
         'testing and early clinical trials, we will learn a lot more about '
         'the best way to further advance genome editing as therapies.”\n'
         'Harvard geneticist George Church, who was also involved in early '
         'CRISPR work, says he is already working to overcome the problem. “My '
         'lab and others have explored many species and enzymes” that could be '
         'used in lieu of Cas9, he wrote in an e-mail. “We are also looking '
         'into various approaches to immune tolerance.”\n'
         'Current gene therapies rely on a virus called adeno-associated virus '
         '(AAV) to deliver the gene-editing tool to every cell. People who '
         'already have immunity to AAV have been excluded from trials or '
         'therapies because their immune systems are likely to clear the '
         'treatment before it can have a therapeutic effect. That strategy of '
         'exclusion would not work with Cas9, Stanford’s Porteus says, because '
         'too many adults have been exposed to strep and staph. “What I think '
         'is surprising is the high proportion of people who already have '
         'immunity,” he says.\n'
         'The Stanford researchers first looked for and found Cas9 antibodies '
         'in human cord blood samples. Their presence shows that human B '
         'cells, part of the so-called innate immune system, can secrete '
         'antibodies that recognize Cas9. Next they looked in blood samples '
         'from 13 adults to see if they had T cells—part of the adaptive '
         'cellular immune system that responds to specific infections—designed '
         'to attack cells expressing staph or strep Cas9s. About half had T '
         'cells that recognized staph Cas9 but none had detectable T cells '
         'that recognized strep Cas9. The immune system’s ability to recognize '
         'the enzyme and the fact many people have T cells aimed at fighting '
         'it, Porteus says, suggest CRISPR may not be as safe and effective in '
         'people as it has been in mice.\n'
         'Porteus notes he pushed to have the study published online as a '
         'preprint while the manuscript works its way through the standard '
         'peer-review process. He hopes the faster publication will lead more '
         'rapidly to solutions—perhaps finding new Cas9s from bacteria that do '
         'not normally infect people. The team included all its data and '
         'figures so others can independently evaluate their findings.\n'
         'Wagers, who raised the issue of immune responses to CRISPR in a 2016 '
         'paper, cautions against reading too much into the new study, '
         'however. It relies on a tiny number of blood samples, and peer '
         'reviewers might still find flaws in the methodology and results, she '
         'says.\n'
         'Wagers thinks it should be feasible to design Cas9s that are based '
         'on more than just the two types of bacteria, and it is unlikely that '
         'a patient in need of gene editing would have immunity to the full '
         'range of possibilities. The paper should serve as more of a reminder '
         'than a shocker. “You’re introducing a foreign protein,” she says, '
         'referring to Cas9. “The immune system is an important component of '
         'how our bodies work, and we have to pay it the respect it '
         'deserves.”\n',

         'the latest cloning work. “If you have a population of nonhuman '
         'primates that are genetically identical, that’s a really, really '
         'powerful model to study human disease, underlying mechanisms and '
         'potential cures. But it has to be done on a case-by-case basis to '
         'justify doing that.” Many countries, including the U.S., have strict '
         'guidelines on primate research due to ethical concerns about '
         'experimenting on our close genetic relatives. For example, U.S. '
         'government biomedical research on chimpanzees is effectively over, '
         'and all lab chimps are being slowly retired.\n'
         'Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of '
         'Neuroscience, in Shanghai, published a report on their two primate '
         'successes Wednesday in Cell. The cloning technique they used, called '
         'somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), involves swapping the nucleus '
         'of a donor cell into a fertilized egg that has been purged of its '
         'own chromosomes. The egg will then contain an exact copy of the '
         'donor’s genome, and if it is implanted into a surrogate mother, the '
         'eventual offspring will be a clone. More than 20 other species, '
         'including pigs and dogs, had already been successfully cloned using '
         'SCNT. And numerous studies of animals produced by this method '
         'indicate they are as healthy as their noncloned cousins.\n'
         'Making this process work in primates has been tough. When '
         'researchers previously tried using the “Dolly” approach on monkeys '
         'it produced fetuses—but no pregnancy that lasted beyond 80 days. The '
         'main obstacle, the Institute of Neuroscience researchers wrote, was '
         'likely that transferred nuclei were not properly programmed to '
         'support embryonic development. So this time the Chinese team '
         'deployed two critical enzymes that removed genes’ epigenetic memory '
         'of being somatic cells (cells that make up tissues and organs). This '
         'extra step allowed development to proceed, says stem cell expert '
         'Alan Trounson, an emeritus professor at the Hudson Institute of '
         'Medical Research in Australia who was not involved in the new '
         'research. The success rate was still extremely low. But as '
         'scientists adjust their methods they could create dozens of clones '
         'in the near future, he notes.\n'
         'Researchers have managed to clone nonhuman primates in the past '
         'couple of decades using other techniques, including a similar '
         'nuclear transfer method that relies on embryonic stem cells instead '
         'of somatic cells. But using SCNT is a major advance because it would '
         'likely be easier to use and reproduce in large numbers. It could '
         'also be more successfully coupled with CRISPR gene-editing '
         'techniques for future research on specific diseases or genetic '
         'mutations, the Institute scientists wrote in their paper.\n'
         'This approach to cloning could eventually help save endangered '
         'primates, Sinclair says. In situations where habitat destruction has '
         'left only a small number of primates, he adds, researchers could '
         'obtain somatic cells from body tissue and freeze it for storage in '
         'gene banks. But this would require further scientific progress, '
         'because the recent Chinese SCNT work was successful using fetal '
         'cells—not adult cells, which can be more difficult to reprogram.\n'
         'Aspects of monkey SCNT will also need to be improved before the '
         'technology can be used to produce primates for research, experts '
         'caution. “From a scientific standpoint the advances here are '
         'significant. But from a practical, immediate utilization perspective '
         'there are still some technical issues that exist,” says Jon '
         'Hennebold, chief of the division of reproductive and developmental '

         'damages. What if those damages had biological consequences? Could '
         'bioterrorists target government laboratories studying infectious '
         'diseases? What about pharmaceutical companies producing lifesaving '
         'drugs? As life scientists become more reliant on digital workflows, '
         'the chances are likely rising.\n'
         'The ease of accessing genetic information online has democratized '
         'science, enabling amateur scientists in community laboratories to '
         'tackle challenges\xa0like developing affordable insulin.\n'
         'But the line between physical DNA sequences and their digital '
         'representation is becoming increasingly blurry. Digital information, '
         'including\xa0malware, can now be\xa0stored and transmitted via DNA. '
         'The J. Craig Venter Institute even created an entire\xa0synthetic '
         'genome\xa0watermarked with encoded links and hidden messages.\n'
         'Twenty years ago, genetic engineers could only create new DNA '
         'molecules by stitching together natural DNA molecules. Today '
         'scientists can use chemical processes to produce synthetic DNA.\n'
         'The sequence of these molecules is often generated using software. '
         'In the same way that electrical engineers use\xa0software to design '
         'computer chips\xa0and computer engineers use\xa0software to write '
         'computer programs, genetic engineers use software to design genes.\n'
         'That means that access to specific physical samples is no longer '
         'necessary to create new biological samples. To say that all you need '
         'to create a dangerous human pathogen is internet access would be an '
         'overstatement – but only a slight one. For instance, in 2006, a '
         'journalist used publicly available data to order a fragment of\xa0'
         'smallpox DNA\xa0in the mail. The year before, the Centers for '
         'Disease Control used published DNA sequences as a blueprint to\xa0'
         'reconstruct the virus responsible for the Spanish flu, one of the '
         'deadliest pandemics of all time.\n'
         'With the help of computers, editing and writing DNA sequences is '
         'almost as easy as manipulating text documents. And it can be done '
         'with malicious intent.\n'
         'The conversations around cyberbiosecurity so far have largely '
         'focused on doomsday scenarios. The threats are bidirectional.\n'
         'On the one hand, computer viruses like Stuxnet could be used to hack '
         'into digitally controlled machinery in biology labs. DNA could even '
         'be used to deliver the attack by encoding\xa0malware\xa0that is '
         'unlocked when the DNA sequences are translated into digital files by '
         'a sequencing computer.\n'
         'On the other hand, bad actors could use software and digital '
         'databases to design or reconstruct pathogens. If nefarious agents\xa0'
         'hacked into sequence databases\xa0or digitally designed novel DNA '
         'molecules with the intent to cause harm, the results could be '
         'catastrophic.\n'
         'And not all cyberbiosecurity threats are premeditated or criminal. '
         'Unintentional errors that occur while translating between a physical '
         'DNA molecule and its digital reference are common. These errors '
         'might not compromise national security, but they could cause costly '
         'delays or product recalls.\n'
         'Despite these risks, it is not unusual for researchers to order '
         'samples from a collaborator or a company and never bother to confirm '
         'that the physical sample they receive matches the digital sequence '
         'they were expecting.\n'
         'Infrastructure changes and new technologies could help increase the '
         'security of life science workflows. For instance, voluntary\xa0'
         'screening guidelines\xa0are already in place to help DNA synthesis '
         'companies screen orders for known pathogens. Universities could '
         'institute similar mandatory guidelines for any outgoing DNA '
         'synthesis orders.\n'
         'There is also currently no simple, affordable way to confirm DNA '
         'samples by whole genome sequencing. Simplified protocols and '
         'user-friendly software could be developed, so that screening by '
         'sequencing becomes routine.\n'
         'The ability to manipulate DNA was once the privilege of the select '
         'few and very limited in scope and application. Today, life '
         'scientists rely on a global supply chain and a network of computers '
         'that manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways. The\xa0time to start '

 'description': 'Cancerous cells and placental ones appear to regulate the '
                'immune system in similar ways',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Can Pregnancy Help Scientists Better Understand Cancer?',
 'text': 'Stvetomir Markovic\xa0knew something was different. Sometime around '
         '2010, a fellow scientist at the Mayo Clinic had agreed to donate her '
         'healthy blood for use in the research laboratory where Markovic '
         'studies the interface between cancer and the immune system. In '
         'previous testing of the woman’s blood, her immune cells functioned '
         'normally. But then something changed, and nobody knew why.\n'
         '“We thought our assays weren’t working,” recalls Markovic, a '
         'hematologist and oncologist whose research focuses on developing '
         'immunotherapies for melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Or perhaps '
         'the reagents had expired, or the laboratory’s machines needed '
         'fine-tuning. For nearly a month, the team puzzled over the woman’s '
         'changing lab values. “At this point, she was quite visibly '
         'pregnant,” Markovic laughs, noting how obvious the answer seems in '
         'hindsight. “It finally dawned on me—what if it’s the pregnancy?”\n'
         'Sensing that the question’s answer could have implications for his '
         'cancer research, Markovic decided to study cells of the placenta, '
         'the disk-shaped organ that develops during pregnancy and connects '
         'the mother’s blood supply with that of her fetus. In the eight years '
         'since then, Markovic and other researchers have discovered some '
         'remarkable similarities in how cancer cells and placental cells '
         'regulate the immune system. This knowledge may one day lead to '
         'better cancer detection and treatment. For now, though, researchers '
         'are focused on deciphering the underlying process—and answering a '
         'sobering question: Are the cells of death exploiting the mechanisms '
         'intended to promote the cells of life?\n'
         'Typically, when the body senses a foreign substance such as a virus '
         'or a bacterium, it sends immune cells to attack the invader while '
         'also bolstering the immune system as a whole. Cancer cells are '
         'vulnerable to this kind of attack because they produce mutated '
         'proteins that the immune system may identify as foreign. But cancer '
         'cells can\xa0escape immune surveillance\xa0using a variety of '
         'techniques to\xa0disguise themselves.\n'
         'Until recently, Markovic says, most scientists believed that outside '
         'of localized changes near the cancer cells, the immune system of '
         'cancer patients essentially functioned normally. But as a young '
         'researcher in the early 2000s, he wasn’t convinced this told the '
         'whole story. He tested that idea by comparing immune-cell activity '
         'in the blood of healthy people and cancer patients.\n'
         'What he found was that cancer doesn’t merely disrupt the immune '
         'response around the tumor—it affects the entire system. One of his '
         'team’s early\xa0findings, published in 2011, was that tumors have '
         'high levels of a particular protein known to suppress the immune '
         'system and induce a state of system-wide chronic inflammation. He '
         'says in his experiments, the immune system “was totally unable to '
         'fight.” What’s more, it became increasingly protective of cancer '
         'cells. He wondered: “How could a tiny cancer cell cause such '
         'dysfunction across the whole body’s immune system?”\n'
         'Markovic theorized that tumors train the immune system to tolerate '
         'their foreign protein, though he wasn’t sure how until the pregnant '
         'researcher’s blood got him thinking. Researchers already knew that a '
         'woman’s immune system changes during pregnancy. Perhaps these '
         'changes could help explain what happens during cancer.\n'
         'Like tumor\xa0cells, fetal cells are foreign to the body. Half of '
         'their genes come from another source (and in the case of donor eggs '
         'or embryos, all of the genes are foreign). If an organ this '
         'incompatible were transplanted into the body, it would likely be '
         'rejected. But during pregnancy, the fetus is protected from the '
         'mother’s immune system by the placenta, which has specialized '
         'cells—called trophoblasts—that can burrow into the mother’s body '
         'without exciting an attack by the immune system.\n'
         'During pregnancy, a mother’s immune system isn’t switched off, but '
         'it is strategically suppressed, especially during the first '
         'trimester to allow for successful implantation. A subset of immune '
         'cells that manage immune system suppression, known as regulatory T '
         'cells, begins learning to tolerate the fetal cells as non-foreign. '
         'Stanford researchers recently discovered that the changes in an '
         'expectant mother’s immune system follow a\xa0specific timeline\xa0in '
         'full-term pregnancies, which they dubbed an “immunological clock of '
         'pregnancy.” Interestingly, as the clock progresses, regulatory T '
         'cells become increasingly able to tolerate fetal cells.\n'
         'Markovic and his team at the Mayo Clinic wondered if tumors might be '
         'employing some of the same tactics as the placenta to outsmart the '
         'immune system: “Tumor cells may mimic trophoblastic cells of the '
         'placenta in that they downregulate danger signals while increasing '
         'expression of immunosuppressive mediators,” Markovic and his '
         'co-authors\xa0wrote\xa0in a 2015 review paper published in the '
         'journal Frontiers in Immunology. So he and his team compared the top '
         '20 to 30 known immune system regulators in pregnancy with cancer’s '
         'immune system regulators.\n'
         '“I nearly fell off my chair when I saw the data,” Markovic says. '
         '“There was such a profound similarity in regulation of the immune '
         'system by the placenta and by cancer. They were the exact same '
         'players doing the exact same thing.”\n'
         'In particular, two molecules known to play a role in cancer’s '
         'suppression of the immune system are PD-L1 and galectin-9. They '
         'inhibit the abilities of tumor-infiltrating white blood cells and '
         'increase the abilities of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. '
         'PD-L1 sits on the surface of cells and acts as a kind of stop sign, '
         'telling T cells not to attack. To gauge the dampening of the whole '
         'immune system, Markovic and his team tested levels of galectin-9 and '
         'PD-L1 in the blood plasma of pregnant women and of cancer patients. '
         'To determine local immune control, where the invasive tissue '
         'interfaces with normal cells, post-birth placentas and stage-four '
         'melanoma tumors were examined.\n'
         'When compared with the blood of healthy, non-pregnant control '
         'subjects, galectin-9 levels in both pregnant women and cancer '
         'patients were significantly elevated. Similarly, PD-L1 levels were '
         'raised in both groups. In the local areas—the trophoblastic cells of '
         'the placenta and the edges of the tumor—both molecules were found at '
         'high concentrations. In a 2016\xa0study\xa0published in the '
         'journalPlacenta, Markovic’s team concludes that there are indeed '
         '“striking similarities between trophoblasts and tumors.”\n'
         'Of course the immune cells in the pregnant scientist’s blood had '
         'stopped behaving “normally”: the immune system in pregnancy is '
         'anything but normal.\n'
         'This realization “pushed one entire laboratory project in the '
         'direction of understanding the immunology of pregnancy as a model '
         'for immunity of cancer,” Markovic says. One of his students went on '
         'to pursue a Ph.D. on this topic.\n'
         'Markovic is not alone. Researchers at other institutions are also '
         'uncovering parallels between pregnancy and cancer. In both '
         'conditions, the immune system does not merely ignore the invasive '
         'cells, it actively encourages their growth. Scientists at the '
         'Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago '
         'found a “remarkable similarity” between the cells that support the '
         'growth and development in placentas and in tumors. They do this “by '
         'activating the portion of the immune response which initiates and '
         'helps control tissue repair,” the researchers note in the\xa0June '
         '2017 issue\xa0of Gynecologic Oncology.\n'
         'Scientists at the University of Otago in New Zealand have also noted '
         'that this altered immune function occurs when a certain set of genes '
         'is turned on or off. “Essentially, we are using the human placenta '
         'as a model to identify genes that play a key role in invasion in '
         'both the placenta and cancer,” wrote Chi Sutherland, a Ph.D. '
         'candidate leading the project, in an email.\n'
         '“There is an increasing body of evidence in support of functional '
         'and molecular similarities between the placenta and cancer; however, '
         'no one has looked at the particular class of genes that we are '
         'interested in,” she added.\n'
         'Sutherland is looking at a subset of genes known as '
         'retrotransposon-derived genes (RDGs). In the placenta, RDGs have '
         'been found working in pathways associated with many of the tools of '
         'invasion: immune suppression, blood vessel growth, cell '
         'proliferation, and inflammation.\n'
         'Among mammals, the human placenta mounts one of the most extensive '
         'invasions of the uterine wall. This high level of interaction makes '
         'nutrient and waste transfer between mother and fetus more efficient, '
         'but it also risks provoking a stronger maternal immune response.\n'
         'During conception and fetal development, the invasion process is '
         'amazingly complex and intricately regulated, explains Sutherland. In '
         'cancer, that regulation is lost. “We think that these genes, which '
         'are normally only expressed in the placenta to facilitate invasion, '
         'are becoming reactivated in cancer cells and supporting invasion in '
         'this context too,” she says. Her project aims to identify more '
         'placental RDGs and determine whether they are also activated in '
         'cancer cells, and if so, whether they promote cancer cell invasion.\n'
         '“We think some of these genes could be ‘hijacked’ by cancer cells '
         'and may contribute to the shared invasive characteristics of the '
         'placenta and cancer,” Sutherland says. If this is the case, then '
         'cancer cells do, in fact, exploit the very mechanisms that make it '
         'possible for a fetus to survive inside a woman’s womb.\n'
         'Currently, several medications that\xa0inhibit PD-L1\xa0are used in '
         'cancer immunotherapy. The problem is that when T cells are allowed '
         'to attack, they can destroy both cancer cells and healthy cells, '
         'leading to a wide array of side effects. Sutherland says the genes '
         'she studies are already silenced in healthy adult tissue, so '
         'theoretically researchers should be able to design therapies that '
         're-silence them in cancer cells without side effects.\n'
         'For his part, Markovic plans to research diseases of the placenta, '
         'to see whether there is an on/off switch for its control of the '
         'immune system. He is hopeful that if better understood, these '
         'biological mechanisms could illuminate new ways of treating cancer. '
         'As of today, his team has one “candidate molecule” that they hope to '
         'bring into clinical studies within the next 18 months, and a second '
         'one that is showing great promise.\n'
         'And of course, it is not lost on Markovic—and certainly not on his '
         'wife, he says—that this promising line of inquiry might never have '
         'been explored, had that female colleague not been working as a '
         'medical research scientist at the Mayo clinic eight years back; had '
         'she not volunteered to donate her blood for Markovic’s research; and '
         'had she not continued to work—and donate—after becoming pregnant.\n'
         'When Markovic told his wife, a cardiologist, about his discovery of '
         'the striking similarities between how tumors and placentas control '
         'the immune system, he describes her as being wholly unsurprised.\n'
         '“See?” Markovic recalls her replying. “Women had the answer all '
         'along.”\n'

 'description': 'Scientists have used CRISPR to turn microbes into tiny '
                'recording devices',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Bacterial "Tape Recorder" Could Keep Tabs on Bodily Functions',
 'text': 'CRISPR is best known as being the basis of a powerful gene-editing '
         'tool. But first and foremost, it is a defense that bacteria use '
         'against viruses. Inspired by this delicate natural system, '
         'researchers have now created another scientific application for it—a '
         'tiny “tape recorder” that chronicles biological signals on strands '
         "of a bacterium's DNA.\n"
         'The investigators believe this microbial recorder could eventually '
         'be used for sensing abnormalities in bodily functions such as '
         'digestion; for measuring pollutant levels in oceans; or for '
         'detecting nutrient changes in soil. It works much like the natural '
         'CRISPR system in many bacteria and other single-cell organisms, '
         'except for the signals it detects.\n'
         'CRISPR is a DNA sequence that makes and keeps a genetic record of '
         'viruses the bacterium encounters, commanding it to kill any that try '
         'to reinfect the bacterium or its descendants. Whereas the natural '
         'CRISPR system remembers viral DNA, the new application can track a '
         'variety of biochemical signals. For example, these bacterial '
         "recorders could detect the presence of the sugar fucose in a human's "
         'gut, indicating an infection.\n'
         'When the bacterium senses a specified signal, it creates many copies '
         'of what is called trigger DNA, which get recorded on one end of its '
         'genetic “tape.” The tape continues to record in the absence of the '
         'designated signal, registering the “background noise” of other '
         'pieces of DNA sloshing around in the cells. These background signals '
         'serve as time stamps on the recordings. Columbia University '
         'scientists reported the findings in a study published last December '
         'in Science.\n'
         'The researchers suggest that a few million bacteria outfitted with '
         'copies of this tool could be deployed in the human body or the '
         'environment, where they would passively record until they are '
         'recovered from feces or soil samples and the tapes can be read. '
         'Unlike most previous biological memory systems, this one is fully '
         "under the bacterial cells' control.\n"
         '“The DNA is writing itself in response to changes in the '
         'environment, whereas in the prior work you sort of had a puppeteer '
         'showing that the DNA could be written—but somebody was pulling the '
         'strings,” says Drew Endy, a synthetic biologist at Stanford '
         'University, who was not part of the study.\n'
         'Although this technique has been tested only in the laboratory, the '
         'team showed it could continuously record three different signals in '
         'a population of Escherichia coli cells for three consecutive days.\n'
         'Recording ability decreased with time, probably because operating as '
         'a tape recorder does not confer any survival benefits, Endy says. He '
         'also notes that the signal needs to be present for six hours for the '
         'tool to reliably record it, which may be too long to detect fleeting '
         'signals. Harris Wang, a synthetic biologist at Columbia and senior '
         'researcher on the study, hopes to speed that up in future work.\n',

         'with objects or infected people, thrives in hospitals, causing '
         '453,000 cases a year and 29,000 deaths in the United States, '
         'according to a 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. '
         'Traditional methods such as monitoring hygiene and warning signs '
         'often fail to stop the disease.\n'
         'But what if it were possible to systematically target those most '
         'vulnerable to C-diff? Erica Shenoy, an infectious-disease specialist '
         'at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Jenna Wiens, a computer '
         'scientist and assistant professor of engineering at the University '
         'of Michigan, did just that when they created an algorithm to predict '
         'a patient’s risk of developing a C-diff infection, or CDI. Using '
         'patients’ vital signs and other health records, this method—still in '
         'an experimental phase—is something both researchers want to see '
         'integrated into hospital routines.\n'
         'The CDI algorithm—based on a form of artificial intelligence called '
         'machine learning—is at the leading edge of a technological wave '
         'starting to hit the U.S. health care industry. After years of '
         'experimentation, machine learning’s predictive powers are '
         'well-established, and it is poised to move from labs to broad '
         'real-world applications, said Zeeshan Syed, who directs Stanford '
         'University’s Clinical Inference and Algorithms Program.\n'
         '“The implications of machine learning are profound,” Syed said. “Yet '
         'it also promises to be an unpredictable, disruptive force—likely to '
         'alter the way medical decisions are made and put some people out of '
         'work.\n'
         'Machine learning (ML) relies on artificial neural networks that '
         'roughly mimic the way animal brains learn.\n'
         'As a fox maps new terrain, for instance, responding to smells, '
         'sights and noises, it continually adapts and refines its behavior to '
         'maximize the odds of finding its next meal. Neural networks map '
         'virtual terrains of ones and zeroes. A machine learning algorithm '
         'programmed to identify images of coffee cups might compare photos of '
         'random objects against a database of coffee cup pictures; by '
         'examining more images, it systematically learns the features to make '
         'a positive ID more quickly and accurately.\n'
         'Shenoy and Wiens’ CDI algorithm analyzed a data set from 374,000 '
         'inpatient admissions to Massachusetts General Hospital and the '
         'University of Michigan Health System, seeking connections between '
         'cases of CDI and the circumstances behind them.\n'
         'The records contained over 4,000 distinct variables. “We have data '
         'pertaining to everything from lab results to what bed they are in, '
         'to who is in the bed next to them and whether they are infected. We '
         'included all medications, labs and diagnoses. And we extracted this '
         'on a daily basis,” Wiens said. “You can imagine, as the patient '
         'moves around the hospital, risk evolves over time, and we wanted to '
         'capture that.”\n'
         'As it repeatedly analyzes this data, the ML process extracts warning '
         'signs of disease that doctors may miss—constellations of symptoms, '
         'circumstances and details of medical history most likely to result '
         'in infection at any point in the hospital stay.\n'
         'Such algorithms, now commonplace in internet commerce, finance and '
         'self-driving cars, are relatively untested in medicine and health '
         'care. In the U.S., the transition from written to electronic health '
         'records has been slow, and the format and quality of the data still '
         'vary by health system—and sometimes down to the medical practice '
         'level—creating obstacles for computer scientists.\n'
         'But other trends are proving inexorable: Computing power has grown '
         'exponentially while getting cheaper. Once, creating a machine '
         'learning algorithm required networks of mainframe computers; now it '
         'can be done on a laptop.\n'
         'Radiology and pathology will experience the changes first, experts '
         'say. Machine learning programs will most easily handle analyzing '
         'images. X-rays and MRI, PET and CT scans are, after all, masses of '
         'data. By crunching the data contained in thousands of existing scan '
         'images along with the diagnoses doctors have made from them, '
         'algorithms can distill the collective knowledge of the medical '
         'establishment in days or hours. This enables them to duplicate or '
         'surpass the accuracy of any single doctor.\n'
         'Machine learning algorithms can now reliably diagnose skin cancers '
         '(from photographs) and lung cancer, and predict the risk of '
         'seizures.\n'
         'Google research scientist Lily Peng, a physician, led a team that '
         'developed a machine learning algorithm to diagnose a patient’s risk '
         'of diabetic retinopathy from a retinal scan. DR, a common side '
         'effect of diabetes, can lead to blindness if left untreated. The '
         'worldwide rise in diabetes rates has turned DR into a global health '
         'problem, with the number of cases expected to rise from 126.6 '
         'million in 2011 to 191 million by 2030—an increase of nearly 51 '
         'percent. Its presence is indicated by increasingly muddy-looking '
         'scan images.\n'
         'Peng’s team gathered 128,000 retinal scans from hospitals in India '
         'and the U.S. and assembled a team of 54 ophthalmologists to grade '
         'them on a 5-point scale for signs of the disease. Multiple doctors '
         'reviewed each image to average out individual differences of '
         'interpretation.\n'
         'Once “trained” on an initial data set with the diagnoses, the '
         'algorithm was tested on another set of data—and there it slightly '
         'exceeded the collective performance of the ophthalmologists.\n'
         'Now Peng is working on applying this tool in India, where a chronic '
         'shortage of ophthalmologists means DR often goes undiagnosed and '
         'untreated until it’s too late to save a patient’s vision. (This is '
         'also a problem in the U.S., where 38 percent of adult diabetes '
         'patients do not get the recommended annual eye check for the '
         'disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control.)\n'
         'A group of Indian hospitals is now testing the algorithm. '
         'Ordinarily, a scan is done, and a patient may wait days for results '
         'after a specialist—if available—reads the image. The algorithm, via '
         'software running on hospital computers, makes the results available '
         'immediately and a patient can be referred to treatment.\n'
         'Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first '
         'medical machine learning algorithm for commercial use by the San '
         'Francisco company Arterys. Its algorithm, “DeepVentricle,” performs '
         'in 30 seconds a task doctors typically do by hand—drawing the '
         'contours of ventricles from multiple MRI scans of the heart muscle '
         'in motion, in order to calculate the volume of blood passing '
         'through. That takes an average of 45 minutes. “It’s automating '
         'something that is important—and tedious,” said Carla Leibowitz, '
         'Arterys’ head of strategy and marketing.\n'
         'If adopted on a broad scale, such technologies could save lots of '
         'time and money. But such change is disruptive.\n'
         '“The fact that we have identified potential ways to gut out costs is '
         'good news. The problem is the people who get gutted are not going to '
         'like it—so there will be resistance,” said Eric Topol, director of '
         'the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “It undercuts how '
         'radiologists do their work. Their primary work is reading scans—what '
         'happens when they don’t have to do that?”\n'
         'The shift may not put a lot of doctors out of work, said Topol, who '
         'co-authored a piece in JAMA exploring the issue. Rather, it will '
         'likely push them to find new ways to apply their expertise. They may '
         'focus on more challenging diagnoses where algorithms continue to '
         'fall short, for instance, or interact more with patients.\n'
         'Beyond this frontier, algorithms can provide a more precise '
         'prognosis for the course of a disease—potentially reshaping '
         'treatment of progressive ailments or addressing the uncertainties in '
         'end-of-life care. They can anticipate fast-moving infections like '
         'CDI and chronic ailments such as heart failure.\n'
         'As the U.S. population ages, heart failure will be a rising burden '
         'on the health system and on families.\n'
         '“It’s the most expensive single disease as a category because of the '
         'extreme disability it causes and the high demand for care it '
         'imposes, if not managed really tightly,” said Walter “Buzz“ Stewart, '
         'vice president and chief research officer at Sutter Health, a health '
         'system in Northern California. “If we could predict who was going to '
         'get it, perhaps we could begin to intervene much earlier, maybe a '
         'year or two years earlier than when it usually happens—when we admit '
         'a patient to the hospital after a cardiac event or crash.”\n'
         'Stewart has collaborated on several studies aiming to address that '
         'problem. One, done with Georgia Tech computer scientist Jimeng Sun, '
         'predicts whether a patient will develop heart failure within six '
         'months, based on 12 to 18 months of outpatient medical records.\n'
         'These tools, Stewart said, are leading to the “mass customization of '
         'health care.” Once algorithms can anticipate incipient stages of '
         'conditions like heart failure, doctors will be better able to offer '
         'treatments tailored to the patient’s circumstances.\xa0\n'
         'Despite its scientific promise, machine learning in medicine remains '
         'terra incognita in many ways. It adds a new voice—the voice of the '
         'machine—to key medical decisions, for instance. Doctors and patients '
         'may be slow to accept that. Adding to potential doubts, machine '
         'learning is often a black box: Data go in, and answers come out, but '
         'it’s often unclear why certain patterns in a patient’s data point, '
         'say, to an emerging disease. Even the scientists who program neural '
         'networks often don’t understand how they reach their conclusions.\n'
         '“It’s going to make a big difference in how decisions are '
         'made—things will become much more data-driven than they used to be,” '
         'said John Guttag, a professor of computer science at MIT. Doctors '
         'will rely on these increasingly complex tools to make decisions, he '
         'said, and “have no idea how they work.” And, in some cases, it will '
         'be hard to figure out why bad advice was given.\n'
         'And while health data are proliferating, the quantity, quality and '
         'format vary by institution, and that affects what the algorithms '
         '“learn.”\n'
         '“That is a huge issue with modeling and electronic health records,” '
         'Sun said. “Because the data are not curated for research purposes. '
         'They are collected as a byproduct of care in day-to-day operations, '
         'and utilized mainly for billing and reimbursement purposes. The data '
         'is very, very noisy.”\n'
         'This also means that data may be inconsistent, even in an individual '
         'patient’s records. More important, one size does not fit all: An '
         'algorithm developed with data from one hospital or health system may '
         'not work well for another. “So you need models for different '
         'institutions, and the models become quite fragile, you might put '
         'it,” Sun said. He is working on a National Institutes of Health '
         'grant studying how to develop algorithms that will work across '
         'institutions.\n'
         'And the tide of available medical data continues to rise, '
         'tantalizing scientists. “Think about all the data we are collecting '
         'right now,” Wiens said. “Electronic health records. '
         'Hospitalizations. At outpatient centers. At home. We are starting to '
         'collect lots of data on personal monitors. These data are valuable '
         'in ways we can’t yet know.”\n'

 'text': 'WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. —For the crowd of mostly baby boomers, who’d '
         'just finished their healthy lunch of salmon fillet on a bed of '
         'grains and vegetables, the warning could not have been more dire: '
         'You’re running out of time.\n'
         '“We can’t sit still. We don’t have the time to do that,” bellowed '
         'Bill Faloon, the 63-year-old former mortician addressing them from '
         'the stage. To his left and right, giant screens projecting\xa0'
         'government actuarial tables\xa0reminded the group of the “projected '
         'year of our termination.” Men of Faloon’s age could expect to die in '
         '2037. Any 83-year-old women in the room? They’ve got until only '
         '2026.\n'
         '“Take that initiative,” Faloon urged his audience of about 120 '
         'people who had flown in from as far as California, Scotland, and '
         'Spain. How? Paying to participate in a soon-to-launch clinical trial '
         'testing transfusions of young blood “offers the greatest potential '
         'for everyone in this room to add a lot of healthy years to their '
         'life,” Faloon said. “Not only do you get to potentially live longer '
         '… but you’re going to be healthier. And some of the chronic problems '
         'you have now may disappear.”\n'
         'STAT got an inside look at this\xa0$195-a-head symposium, held last '
         'month in this wealthy beachside enclave. It offered a striking view '
         'of how promoters aggressively market scientifically dubious elixirs '
         'to aging people desperate to defy their own mortality.\n'
         'At STAT’s request, eight independent experts reviewed\xa0'
         'informational\xa0handouts\xa0about the clinical trial, and all '
         'sharply criticized the study’s marketing, design, and scientific '
         'rationale.\n'
         '“It just reeks of snake oil,” said Michael Conboy, a cell and '
         'molecular biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who’s '
         'collaborated on studies sewing old and young mice together and '
         'transfusing blood between them. “There’s no evidence in my mind that '
         'it’s going to work.”\n'
         'Beyond the questionable science, participants have to pay big money '
         'to join the trial. Faloon, an evangelist of anti-aging research who '
         'cut a slim figure in his black suit and had the thick dark hair of a '
         'younger man, acknowledged during his talk that it would be '
         '“expensive” to sign up for the trial.\n'
         'People considering enrolling said they had been told they would have '
         'to pay $285,000. But the Florida physician running the trial, Dr. '
         'Dipnarine Maharaj, said the final price tag is still being discussed '
         'in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration and is likely '
         'to change.\n'
         'There’s long been a thriving market of supplements, creams, and '
         'pills that promise to forestall aging.\n'
         'But lately, big players and investors\xa0have also spotted an '
         'opportunity: Google’s parent company has invested heavily in its '
         'secretive anti-aging spinout, called Calico. A startup called '
         'Celularity last month\xa0raised $250 million\xa0to try to use '
         'postpartum placentas to delay the aging process. And a company '
         'called Elysium Health has rallied Nobel Prize winners to sell a '
         '$50-per-month supplement aimed at boosting levels of a molecule '
         'known as NAD+ that’s hypothesized to play a role in promoting '
         'longevity, though not without\xa0prompting rebuke\xa0from some '
         'prominent doctors.\n'
         'Lower-cost technologies and a receptive audience are expanding that '
         'economy, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs to pitch '
         'everyone from Silicon Valley titans to middle-America retirees on '
         'unproven and costly services like banking stem cells and '
         'injecting\xa0hormones.\n'
         'Such services are often promoted at events that University of '
         'California, Davis, stem cell researcher Paul Knoepfler calls '
         '“infomercial seminars.” In January, for example, a company called '
         'Celltex Therapeutics\xa0pitched its stem cell treatments\xa0to '
         'would-be patients over wine and shrimp at a Houston hotel.\n'
         'Then there’s the West Palm Beach symposium, held to recruit '
         'participants for a study testing what happens when aging people get '
         'infusions of plasma (the fluid part of blood packed with signaling '
         'proteins and other molecules but no red or white cells) from young '
         'people who’ve taken a drug meant to activate their immune system. '
         'Maharaj, a Scottish-trained hematologist and oncologist with a flair '
         'for salesmanship, plans to run the 30-patient trial at the\xa0'
         'private practice\xa0he owns in Boynton Beach, Fla.\n'
         'The study, which he describes as a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial, is a '
         'first-in-human test, which means that it is designed to evaluate '
         'only whether the experimental therapy is safe. But in his remarks at '
         'the symposium, Maharaj didn’t hesitate to make bold promises about '
         'what the treatment could do to ameliorate the frailty that results '
         'from getting older.\n'
         '“We’re saying that we will defy aging,” Maharaj told the crowd at '
         'one point. “We believe that this could benefit everyone who is '
         'here,” he declared at another moment.\n'
         'The experts consulted by STAT were dubious. Among their top '
         'concerns: Mixed but intriguing evidence in mice doesn’t yet justify '
         'testing this idea in humans, much less charging them a huge sum to '
         'sign up. And the study uses neither blinding nor a placebo group, '
         'design elements considered essential for rigorous medical research.\n'
         '“There is no way under heaven that they will be able to convincingly '
         'show whether this works or this doesn’t work. It’s a trial that is '
         'designed and destined to provide no valuable information,” said Dr. '
         'Steven Joffe, a pediatric oncologist and bioethicist at the '
         'University of Pennsylvania who performs bone marrow transplants. He '
         'called the scientific hypothesis “incredibly far-fetched.”\n'
         'Asked about the critiques, Maharaj declined to comment, saying he '
         'had been advised to wait until he releases more information about '
         'the trial. He suggested that publicity is already impeding his '
         'ability to move forward with the study.\n'
         'The “young blood project” symposium was gussied up as one of the '
         'dozens of galas that fill the winter social calendar here, with the '
         'pitch for Maharaj’s clinical trial artfully slipped in before the '
         'dessert of fruit and custard tart.\n'
         'It was held on a Friday in February, at a glitzy performing arts '
         'center overlooking a Hilton hotel and a Ruth’s Chris Steak House. '
         'Five fountains spurted from a reflecting pool outside flanked by '
         'palm trees.\n'
         'It’s about a 15-minute drive north of President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago '
         'club and some 250 miles south of the site of the conquistador Ponce '
         'de León’s mythical search for the fountain of youth, now converted '
         'into a tourist attraction and a wedding venue.\n'
         '“Hopefully, one day we’ll be able to announce that Florida is truly '
         'the fountain of youth,” Maharaj told the crowd inside while he '
         'talked up his clinical trial.\n'
         'Maharaj —charismatic and impossible to miss with his tan suit, pink '
         'tie, and Scottish accent —was the star of the show. He darted from '
         'table to table, talking to so many attendees that he didn’t have '
         'time for lunch. And he left an impression: Without exception, '
         'attendees spoke glowingly about Maharaj in interviews with STAT.\n'
         'Maharaj made his name in Florida performing bone marrow transplants '
         'for cancer patients and, increasingly, offering nontraditional '
         'services to a wealthy clientele. His\n'

         'banking for babies and adults, an increasingly popular procedure '
         'promising future dividends that are\xa0unproven and uncertain. (And '
         'Maharaj practices what he preaches: He said he’s had his own stem '
         'cells collected and stored.)\n'
         'Maharaj has become a frequent speaker on the Palm Beach social '
         'circuit. Photos show him\xa0posing at Mar-a-Lago\xa0and\xa0shaking '
         'hands\xa0with the celebrity physician Dr. Mehmet Oz. He was featured '
         'on the cover of Palm Beach Society magazine promoting the '
         'symposium.\n'
         'The attendees —dressed up in slacks, ties, and elegant pantsuits '
         '—were served food and drink throughout the day, beginning with '
         'made-to-order smoothies for breakfast and glasses of wine to cap off '
         'the afternoon. A rotating cast of a violinist, a harpist, and a '
         'pianist provided musical interludes between talks. Fresh white, '
         'pink, and green flowers decorated high tables, but if you looked '
         'closely, some of them were beginning to wilt.\n'
         'In interviews with STAT, the attendees complained about ailments '
         'that hadn’t bothered them when they were younger: Back problems. Bad '
         'hips. The aftermath of a stroke. Parkinson’s disease. Arthritis.\n'
         'Many of them voiced frustration with the medical establishment and '
         'pharmaceutical companies, which they said pay too little attention '
         'to fixing the root cause of disease. Others voiced fears of spending '
         'their final days hooked up to machines in a hospital bed.\n'
         'Asked about their plans for enrolling in the trial, surprisingly few '
         'among the well-heeled crowd said the cost was too high. But if the '
         'experience of Darryl Thompson, 73, and his wife Sherry Thompson, 71, '
         'is any indicator, it may prove hard for Maharaj to convince many of '
         'them to enroll.\n'
         'The Thompsons, who have three grown children and are both retired '
         'after careers in government, flew out to Florida from their home in '
         'Fort Worth, Texas, for the symposium. They were there because Darryl '
         'Thompson had made aging reversal research something of a pet '
         'project. He’d started taking many daily supplements and learning as '
         'much as he could after a series of health scares (high blood '
         'pressure, high uric acid, and an enlarged prostate for Darryl '
         'Thompson, and a diagnosis of congestive heart failure for Sherry '
         'Thompson).\n'
         'Sherry Thompson’s motivation for attending was simpler: “Quite '
         'frankly, I went because Darryl twisted my arm to go,” she said with '
         'a laugh.\n'
         'By the end of the program, Darryl Thompson was eager to enroll in '
         'the trial, but he knew he didn’t want to do it without his wife. And '
         'Sherry Thompson remained hesitant. She was worried about the money, '
         'and the time they’d have to spend flying back and forth from Texas '
         'to Florida once a month for a year. And she was nagged, too, by a '
         'sense that perhaps there’s a natural order to things. That perhaps '
         'we aren’t supposed to live longer than we already do.\n'
         'In the end, Darryl Thompson couldn’t convince her. But he plans to '
         'keep a close eye on the trial. “I’m hoping that they’ll get the cost '
         'down and refine their techniques,” he said. “Possibly my wife and I '
         'could be a candidate for the next round.”\n'
         'Experiments like Maharaj’s operate on the fringes of science, yet '
         'they have captured the public imagination.\xa0Young blood has become '
         'so alluring as a possible way to extend life that it inspired an\xa0'
         'episode\xa0last year on the HBO show “Silicon Valley,” in which an '
         'aging tech mogul relies on blood infusions from a handsome young man '
         'known as “an infusion associate.”\xa0Even the billionaire investor '
         'Peter Thiel is\xa0rumored\xa0to be personally interested in the '
         'experimental treatment.\n'
         'Maharaj’s trial wouldn’t be the first to transfuse plasma from young '
         'donors into older people. A biotech startup called Alkahest, spun '
         'out from a Stanford lab,\xa0reported results\xa0in November from a '
         'placebo-controlled safety trial testing the effect of plasma from '
         'young donors on 18 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. The '
         'patients who got the plasma didn’t suffer serious side effects, but '
         'the group didn’t see a statistically significant improvement in '
         'their scores on a widely used cognitive exam.\n'
         'Meanwhile, a company called Ambrosia recently completed a\xa0'
         'clinical trial\xa0that charged about 80 people over the age of 35 a '
         'sum of $8,000 to get an infusion of plasma from a donor between the '
         'ages of 16 and 25. Ambrosia plans later this year to try to publish '
         'those results in a peer-reviewed journal, said Dr. Jesse Karmazin, '
         'the company’s founder.\n'
         'Maharaj and the experts consulted by STAT said that, to their '
         'knowledge, Maharaj’s trial will be the first to try a new twist on '
         'young blood infusions: injecting the young donors with a drug called '
         'granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, or G-CSF.\n'
         'The body makes this glycoprotein naturally, but a form of it sold as '
         'Neupogen by Amgen is approved for cancer patients recovering from '
         'chemotherapy and for healthy people preparing to donate stem cells. '
         'It’s used this way because it stimulates the bone marrow to produce '
         'white blood cells and certain stem cells and release them into the '
         'bloodstream. Maharaj said he chose to use G-CSF because he thinks '
         'it’s the best way to mobilize the proteins and other factors into '
         'young plasma that he thinks could have a restorative effect on the '
         'older participants. (Maharaj\xa0holds several patents\xa0associated '
         'with the therapeutic use of G-CSF.)\n'
         'To run his study, Maharaj plans to recruit donors between the ages '
         'of 18 and 35 and inject them with G-CSF and collect their plasma. In '
         'return, they’ll be paid up to $750.\n'
         'That plasma will be infused once a month for 12 months into the '
         'veins of the older clinical trial participants. Maharaj will enroll '
         'people who are between the ages of 55 and 95 and who demonstrate '
         'several indicators of frailty such as exhaustion and weight loss.\n'
         'To evaluate whether the experimental treatment is safe and whether '
         'it might be able to reduce frailty, Maharaj plans to run a battery '
         'of baseline testing on each clinical trial participant before they '
         'get their first infusion of young plasma and then monitor their '
         'changes for two years: That means cognitive exams, questionnaires '
         'about their quality of life and their indicators of frailty, and '
         'tests to measure biomarkers he believes are linked with aging, such '
         'as telomere lengths and DNA methylation.\n'
         'Maharaj said he didn’t use a placebo group in his study because it '
         'was too expensive and because he believes that the baseline '
         'assessment will allow participants to serve as their own control. He '
         'said that if his trial shows promising results, he’ll run a second '
         'randomized trial using a placebo.\n'
         'Maharaj has not published any animal studies testing the procedure '
         'he’s proposing to try in humans. He did, however,\xa0publish a '
         'paper\xa0last year documenting a study in which he infused three '
         'cancer patients with white blood cells from young donors who had '
         'been injected with G-CSF. The trial was originally intended to '
         'enroll 29 patients, but Maharaj did not answer questions about why '
         'the paper featured results from only three of them.\n'
         'Asked by STAT for citations in the published literature that provide '
         'the scientific basis for his new trial, Maharaj pointed to six '
         'studies. One was conducted on human cells in lab dishes. The other '
         'five were conducted in mice; they found that, after being exposed to '
         'the blood of young mice, old mice had less abnormal thickening of '
         'their heart, grew more nervous tissue, and saw improved cognitive '
         'function, among other changes.\n'
         'But the Harvard stem cell and regenerative biologist Amy Wagers, a '
         'co-author on three of the mouse papers, said in an email to STAT '
         'that she does not agree that her teams’ studies provide a scientific '
         'basis for Maharaj’s clinical trial.\n'
         'The problems are many: Young blood didn’t do much for old mice in\xa0'
         'other studies. Promising findings in mice are rarely replicated in '
         'humans. And the trouble with extrapolating so much from mouse '
         'studies is that “nobody has actually shown over the long term how '
         'long these quote un-quote improvements persist, and we don’t know '
         'whether it’s broadly improving aspects of aging or it’s specific to '
         'certain tissues,” said Matt Kaeberlein, a biologist who studies '
         'aging in dogs and other animal models at the University of '
         'Washington.\n'
         'Clinical trials that charge enrollees to participate are ostensibly '
         'aimed at giving patients early access to promising therapies —often '
         'in the fields of stem cells or aging reversal —that are too unusual '
         'or have too little profit potential to get funding from traditional '
         'sources such as companies, foundations, or the National Institutes '
         'of Health. But critics worry that such trials too often exploit '
         'desperate patients, offering them false hope of restored health '
         'while doing little or nothing to advance scientific research.\n'
         'Maharaj said he spent three years seeking funding for his trial from '
         'foundations but couldn’t close a deal. He said he thinks he was '
         'turned down because his focus on attacking aging-related frailty was '
         'too novel and unfamiliar to would-be funders.\n'
         'As of mid-February, no patients had officially enrolled in Maharaj’s '
         'study, though about 10 had demonstrated interest by calling and '
         'leaving their information with his private practice, Maharaj said. '
         '(He declined STAT’s request to interview these people and would not '
         'provide an update on how many patients had enrolled by the end of '
         'February.)\n'
         'At the symposium, Maharaj said that he had received the go-ahead to '
         'proceed with the study from the FDA and the Western Institutional '
         'Review Board, but did not provide the documents STAT requested to '
         'verify those claims.\n'
         'Lauren Smith Dyer, an FDA spokeswoman, declined to comment on '
         'Maharaj’s trial. In cases in which a clinical trial that’s regulated '
         'by the agency proposes to charge patients to receive an experimental '
         'drug or certain biological products, the sponsor must obtain written '
         'authorization from the FDA, Smith Dyer said.\n'
         'Maharaj’s study is not listed on the government database of human '
         'studies known as clinicaltrials.gov, though he said it will be '
         'registered on the site in the next few days.\n'
         'Faloon has\xa0become perhaps Maharaj’s most vocal cheerleader. He '
         'runs a group called the\xa0Society for the Rescue of Our Elders, '
         'meant to accelerate and\xa0raise funds\xa0for aging-reversal '
         'research, as well as an\xa0online business\xa0that sells “life '
         'extension” supplements.\n'
         'He has no formal stake or involvement in the young-blood clinical '
         'trial, but he’s promoted it heavily. In recent emails to the roughly '
         '2,000 members of the society and a posting on the group’s website, '
         'Faloon wrote that enrolling in the study would cost $285,000 —in an '
         'effort, he said, to be transparent to people who couldn’t afford '
         'it.\n'
         'The publicity seems to have backfired, however. Faloon’s '
         'communication contained “information on pricing which the IRB had '
         'not yet seen,” Maharaj said. “As a result, the IRB has inquired as '
         'to the genesis of that press release, and it has negatively impacted '
         'on my ability to proceed with this study until the IRB is satisfied '
         'that it is receiving all information relevant to the study.” '
         '(Faloon’s team has since removed the pricing information from the '
         'society’s website, in the hope that Maharaj’s study can proceed as '
         'planned.)\n'
         'Faloon\xa0has long bristled at what he sees as excessive regulation '
         'holding back life-saving and -extending therapies. He has tussled in '
         'particular with the FDA, which in 1987 raided his supplement '
         'company’s warehouse, leading to an indictment for allegedly '
         'conspiring to import unapproved drugs into the country; the '
         'indictment was eventually dropped. Over the years, he’s opened what '
         'he’s called an “FDA Holocaust Museum,” which compared the number of '
         'needless deaths he believes the agency has caused\xa0to those caused '
         'by the Nazis, and a “Church of Perpetual Life” to proselytize his '
         'gospel of everlasting life on earth.\n'
         'He doesn’t hesitate when asked whether he wants to live forever —the '
         'answer is yes —but he’s hedging his bets. He’s also a cryonics '
         'enthusiast, he said, “because in the event I die before immortality '
         'is achieved, cryopreservation offers me the opportunity to be '
         'transported into the future where revival may be possible.”\n'
         'When flying, Faloon used to lug a thermally insulated helmet in his '
         'carry-on bag that he’d put on during takeoffs and landings. The idea '
         'was that, in the event the plane crashed and burned, his head could '
         'still be salvaged and frozen. But he no longer takes his helmet on '
         'flights, he said, in part because he’s not sure it will actually '
         'work.\n'
         'The other reason? It’s too much trouble, he said, to get his helmet '
         'through airport security.\n'

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'FDA Approves First Direct-to-Consumer Test for Breast Cancer Risk',
 'text': 'Federal regulators approved the first direct-to-consumer test for '
         'the BRCA genes, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian '
         'cancer, the agency announced on Tuesday.\n'
         'The test for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, from\xa023andMe, uses a '
         'saliva sample. But it assesses only three of the more than 1,000 '
         'known BRCA1/2 mutations, raising concerns that women who are told '
         'they do not have any of those variants will be lulled into believing '
         'that, as a result, they do not have an elevated risk for breast and '
         'ovarian cancer.\n'
         'The three specific BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer gene mutations are most '
         'common in people with Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry, '
         'accounting for more than 90 percent of their risk of heritable '
         'breast and ovarian cancer. But even in this population only 2 '
         'percent of women carry any of these three so-called “founder” '
         'mutations, the FDA said. Women with one of the mutations have a 45 '
         'percent to 85 percent chance of developing breast cancer by age 70, '
         '23andMe said.\n'
         'But these three variants are not the most common BRCA1/BRCA2 '
         'mutations in the general population: No more than 0.1 percent of '
         'women with non-Ashkenazi ancestry carry the mutations. “A negative '
         'result does not rule out the possibility that an individual carries '
         'other BRCA mutations that increase cancer risk,” the FDA warned.\n'
         'The 23andMe test “is a step forward in the availability of DTC '
         'genetic tests,” Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the FDA’s '
         'Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, said in a '
         'statement. “But it has a lot of caveats.”\n'
         'The agency therefore warned that individuals and their physicians '
         'should not use the test results to make decisions about treatments, '
         'including prophylactic removal of the breasts or ovaries. That '
         'should be based on more extensive testing. Myriad Genetics, which '
         'developed the first BRCA1/2 tests, assesses DNA for thousands of '
         'variants; it has long\xa0warned\xa0that other tests, which came on '
         'the market after the Supreme Court threw out Myriad’s key BRCA '
         'patents, could mislead women.\n'
         'In addition, most cases of breast cancer are not hereditary, from '
         'BRCA or other mutations, but “sporadic,” meaning they arise at '
         'random or from smoking, obesity, exposure to toxic chemicals, '
         'hormone use, and other environmental factors.\n'
         '“At a minimum, 23andMe should be clear with people about what their '
         'test is and isn’t and present the information in a fair and balanced '
         'way that the average person can understand,” said Myriad spokesman '
         'Ron Rogers, who added that some customers might be uncomfortable '
         'about 23andMe’s\xa0selling\xa0of genetic information to third '
         'parties.\n'
         'For women with Ashkenazi ancestry, the test “is not too bad as a '
         'screen,” said Robert Cook-Deegan of Arizona State University, a '
         'longtime scholar in the field of genomics ethics and law. “But for '
         'other groups with different founder mutations, and there are many, '
         'it won’t help much. There’s a big need for users to understand that '
         'nuance, which is not widely understood.”\n'
         'The FDA’s decision was based on data from 23andMe showing that its '
         'test can accurately identify the three genetic variants in saliva '
         'samples. The privately held company also submitted studies showing '
         'that consumers understood the report it will send to customers on '
         'what the results might mean, how to interpret them, and where to '
         'find additional information.\n'
         '“Being the first and only direct-to-consumer genetics company to '
         'receive FDA authorization to test for cancer risk without a '
         'prescription is a major milestone for 23andMe and for the consumer,” '
         'Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe CEO and co-founder, said in a statement. “We '
         'believe it’s important for consumers to have direct and affordable '
         'access to this potentially life-saving information. … This '
         'authorization is incredibly valuable for those who might not be '
         'aware of their Ashkenazi Jewish descent.”\n'
         'She, too, emphasized that “our test does not account for all genetic '
         'variants that can cause a higher risk of cancer, and people should '
         'continue with their recommended cancer screenings.” Myriad, for '
         'instance, has identified some 20,000 BRCA1/2 variants.\n'
         'The decision follows\xa0one last year\xa0in which the FDA gave '
         '23andMe the go-ahead to sell DNA tests assessing customers’ risk of '
         '10 diseases, including Parkinson’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s. Those '
         'were the first FDA-approved direct-to-consumer tests for genetic '
         'risk of any disease or condition, which the agency said could help '
         'people make lifestyle decisions. At the time, the FDA also warned '
         'that genetic risk for complex diseases is not a sure thing: People '
         'whose 23andMe test does not find genetic variants that increase the '
         'risk of a disease can still develop it, and people whose DNA test '
         'shows no disease-causing variants might not.\n'
         'The BRCA test will be part of 23andme’s $199 Health + Ancestry test. '
         'Existing customers can opt to receive BRCA information for no '
         'additional cost, and as with the other disease-risk tests they as '
         'well as new customers must specifically choose to receive the '
         'information.\n'
         '“My libertarian streak says this, properly understood, is a good '
         'thing that increases access,” said Cook-Deegan, “although I do worry '
         'about proliferation of commercial purveyors as the sources of '
         'information and keeping the data.”\n'

         "“Could man's life-span be extended, or is there an inescapable aging "
         'mechanism that restricts human longevity to the present apparent '
         'limit? Until recently few biologists ventured to attempt to explore '
         'the basic processes of aging; obviously the subject does not easily '
         'lend itself to detailed study. No doubt many mechanisms are involved '
         'in the aging of the body. In our own laboratory at the Wistar '
         'Institute we have addressed ourselves to one question: the '
         'limitation on cell division. Our studies have focused particularly '
         'on the structural cells called fibroblasts, which produce collagen '
         'and fibrin. These cells, like certain other ‘blast’ cells, go on '

         'Local Government Board, many men have contracted the disease while '

                'thinner structure',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Do Brain-Wiring Differences Make Women More Vulnerable to '
         'Concussions?',
 'text': 'Researchers have known for some time that female athletes experience '
         'higher rates of concussion than their male counterparts, and also '
         'often suffer harsher symptoms and take longer to recover. But why '
         'women seem more vulnerable to such injuries has long remained a '
         'puzzle.\n'
         'Concussion symptoms range from headache, dizziness and confusion to '
         'memory loss, noise or light sensitivity, and irritability. Most '
         'people recover quickly but some develop problems lasting a year or '
         'more. A 2010 study led by neurologist Jeffrey Bazarian of the '
         'University of Rochester found that women—especially those of '
         'child-bearing age—had worse symptoms measured three months after '
         'injury.\n'
         'Several explanations have been proposed including sex hormones, neck '
         'structure and cerebral blood flow, but no one really knows what is '
         'to blame. Now, however, a study led by Douglas Smith, director of '
         'the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of '
         'Pennsylvania, adds a new candidate: differences in axons—the output '
         '“wires” of neurons.\n'
         'Smith and his colleagues discovered differences in the size and '
         'structure of male and female axons\xa0and found the female structure '
         'was more susceptible to damage. “The findings are intriguing,” says '
         'neuropsychologist Donna Broshek of the University of Virginia, who '
         'was not involved in the study. “Many theories have been put forth, '
         'including that—because of differences in cultural '
         'socialization—women are more likely to endorse symptoms.” But the '
         'new results, published recently, “suggest that women report more '
         'symptoms because they are ... experiencing more symptoms,” Broshek '
         'says.\n'
         'Each neuron has many inputs, called dendrites, but generally only '
         'one output: its axon. Along with transmitting the electrical signals '
         'underlying cognition, axons transport cargo of various '
         'kinds—including proteins that are used mainly for repair and '
         'maintenance. Other specialized proteins haul this cargo via the '
         'axons along train track–like structures called microtubules. A major '
         "sign of concussion is damaged axons. “There's an emerging consensus "
         'that one underlying issue with concussion is diffuse axonal injury,” '
         'Smith says. This led him to wonder if the sex differences in '
         'concussions might have something to do with axons. “Is there '
         'something different about brain architecture,” he says, “that given '
         'the same mechanical forces, a female brain may be more injured than '
         'a male brain?”\n'
         'To test this idea, the team first used a cell-culture model in which '
         'two populations of neurons are separated by tiny channels, along '
         'which axons grow. The researchers then used pulses of air to rapidly '
         'stretch the axons, mimicking sudden head trauma. “We found a '
         'dramatic difference,” Smith says. “The female axons had many more '
         'undulations, which were bigger, suggesting more structural damage.” '
         'Undulations occur when microtubules break. Their cargo then spills '
         'and builds up in the axon, causing swelling. Sodium, which is needed '
         'for normal transmission of electrical signals, then rushes in—but '
         'too much of it actually disrupts this signaling. “In concussion you '
         'have an immediate change in mental status, because the electric grid '
         "has been taken out,” Smith says. “It's like a blackout\xa0or "
         'browning out of the city.” The excess sodium also causes calcium to '
         'flood in, activating enzymes that destroy structures inside axons. '
         'Twenty-four hours after being hit with air pulses, the female axons '
         'had more swellings and signaling loss. This was true for both '
         'neurons taken from rats\xa0and human neurons derived from stem cells '
         'that were genetically male or female.\n'
         'The researchers next examined the axons with electron microscopy. '
         'They found the female axons were thinner, with fewer microtubules—a '
         'difference that has been hinted at previously but never directly '
         'demonstrated. They then used a computational model to compare how '
         'the different male and female structures responded to the same '
         'mechanical force. The female structure suffered more breaks. '
         'Microtubules are connected by proteins that become stiffer the '
         'faster they are stretched. And if axons are stretched too rapidly, '
         'these proteins pull on microtubules and break them, Smith says. '
         'Having more microtubules gives the whole structure more stability.\n'
         'The relatively rapid recovery most people experience may reflect the '
         'time it takes to repair axons—but if the damage is too severe, axons '
         "may degenerate. “We think that's the route that has persisting "
         'symptoms,” Smith says. “Up to 20 percent of individuals have '
         "persisting dysfunction; we're really interested in those people, "
         'because we think they have permanent damage.” If he is right, '
         'recovery from long-term symptoms may reflect the time it takes brain '
         'plasticity to compensate for lost cells.\n'
         'How much of the concussion sex differences might be explained by '
         "this discovery is not yet clear. “I'm almost certain this cannot be "
         "the only thing that contributes,” Smith says. “It's probably one of "
         'several factors; time will tell how large a role it plays.” '
         'Differences in rates may be “primarily about axonal damage,” but '
         "recovery time is a different question, Bazarian says. “There's a "
         'host of processes that take place, to clean up, that may also have '
         "sex differences.” Most important is the brain's inflammatory "
         'response, which must be precisely controlled to clean out waste '
         'without doing damage. Hormones regulate this process, which could '
         'explain findings like worse outcomes in child-bearing years. How '
         'effective these processes are—plus injury severity—are likely what '
         "determine recovery times. “It's a combination of the two,” Bazarian "
         'says.\n'
         'A caveat is that cell cultures and models are a far cry from the '
         'immensely complex environment of a real brain. “This sets the stage '
         'for the next step, which is finding some way to verify these '
         'findings in living human brains,” Bazarian says. This will be '
         'challenging, as researchers cannot easily examine live human axons '
         'directly. There are ways around this, however. For example, '
         'researchers can look at less-direct evidence of the damage, such as '
         'changes in white matter. (Nerve fiber tracts appear white due to the '
         'coloring of the myelin sheaths that cover and insulate axons.) “This '
         'will open the door to looking at white matter with advanced '
         'neuroimaging,” Smith says. “Given the same head impacts, do females '
         'have more changes in white matter?”\n'
         'Another promising approach is measuring levels of proteins in blood. '
         "“We're realizing we see these axon proteins in the blood after "
         'injury, which are only there if the axon degenerates,” Smith says. '
         '“Hopefully in the next few years we’ll have a test to identify '
         'individuals who are going to have long-term problems.” This would be '
         'a boon not just for diagnosis but for testing treatments. One reason '
         'clinical trials fail is if the participants are too diverse, so the '
         'treatment is not appropriate for all. If a blood test could identify '
         'patients likely to develop persistent problems, they could be '
         'selected and enrolled in trials targeting the axon damage flagged by '
         'the test.\n',

 'text': 'Do girls take longer than boys to recover after a concussion? A '
         'recent study of middle- and high school athletes they found that the '
         'female athletes took twice as long to be symptom-free as the male '
         'athletes. Shockingly, the female athletes took nearly a full month '
         'to report being symptom-free, while the male athletes took less than '
         'two weeks. It was reported widely across the media as evidence the '
         'young women may have a special problem with concussions.\n'
         'This conclusion, unfortunately, is not well supported. Meta-analyses '
         '(which look at the full body of literature on a topic) have found '
         'conflicting evidence regarding male-female differences in concussion '
         'recovery. Consensus statements on sport-related concussion have not '
         'deemed there to be sufficient reason to distinguish between the '
         'genders for return-to-play protocols or guidelines on handling the '
         'injury. And the study itself has important flaws.\n'
         'There are hundreds of thousands of female athletes who have '
         'scholarships, professional careers, and Olympic hopes at stake, and '
         'let’s not forget the basic principle that our girls deserve equal '
         'opportunity as the boys to participate in sports. These conclusions '
         'have real consequences, and we need to get our information right. '
         'One of the strongest predictive factors for prolonged '
         'post-concussion symptoms is expectation of recovery—those who '
         'believe they will recover quickly are more likely to do so. So if we '
         'label women in this way, it can have a direct, negative effect on '
         'their recovery from concussion.\n'
         'The study by Dr. John Neidecker, an orthopedic doctor in North '
         'Carolina, looked at the medical records of 110 boys and 102 girls '
         'who attended his sports medicine clinic after a concussion. While '
         'boys reported being symptom-free in under 2 weeks, it took girls '
         'almost one month. A big problem here is the lack of an objectively '
         'determined point of recovery—the researchers can’t be faulted here, '
         'because, at the moment, we have no objective marker of concussion '
         'recovery. But, they did not corroborate these results with any '
         'additional, objective tests that could have told us more about the '
         'patients’ brain function. So, the only evidence they show is how '
         'long it took until the kids said they were symptom-free.\n'
         'Self-reporting is the bane of concussion research. Athletes '
         'notoriously underreport symptoms in the preseason as well as after '
         'concussion. We are also assuming that any symptoms that follow the '
         'concussion are because of the concussion, but this is not always '
         'true. On top of this, neurocognitive tests are not as objective as '
         'we think. Many athletes will “tank the baseline”: deliberately '
         'underperform on preseason tests so that if they do get concussed, '
         'their post-injury testing won’t look so bad, and they can get back '
         'to competing.\n'
         'Men’s teams have good reason to try to minimize injuries. An '
         'interesting study by Michael Cusimano, a neurosurgeon at St. '
         'Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, Canada, looked at the culture of '
         'men’s sports by interviewing adolescent boys’ and girls’ hockey '
         'teams. In boys’ hockey, themes of heroism and masculinity fed into '
         'the likelihood to hide concussion symptoms, citing them as '
         'weaknesses and that they were just “part of the tradition of '
         'hockey.” Boys faced more pressure to win than girls, and this made '
         'them more likely to return to play early. In fact, the researchers’ '
         'findings echoed others who reported that males “returned to play '
         'sooner after suffering the same severity concussion as females and '
         'were twice as likely to be noncompliant with return-to-play '
         'guidelines.”\xa0 The researchers found that girls, on the other '
         'hand, were more likely to report concussion injuries and less likely '
         'to return to play prematurely. For girls, desire for academic more '
         'than athletic achievement may increase their likelihood to take more '
         'time to recover from concussion before returning. Boys will be able '
         'to make a substantial income should they go pro; girls, not so much. '
         'Part of the pressure on boys to continue compete is the prospect of '
         'a lucrative professional career—this makes them more likely to '
         'report that their symptoms are gone, so they can get back out '
         'playing.\n'
         'An illuminating study in 2011 assessed 167 children with concussion '
         'and found that emotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., “I let my '
         'feelings out to reduce my stress”) were associated with increased '
         'symptom reporting compared with problem-focused coping strategies '
         '(e.g., “I convinced myself that things were not as bad as they '
         'seem”). While the researchers did not directly compare the sexes, it '
         'is easy to see that socialization of males dictates that they ignore '
         'their emotions and focus on problems, while for women the opposite '
         'is true. If women are socialized to cope with emotion-focused '
         'strategies, they are more likely to report symptoms for longer.\n'
         'There may very well be gender differences in concussion, but when '
         'looking at subjective measures we need to be careful to look at the '
         'whole picture and consider context. If we put the focus on female '
         'athletes by declaring that they “take longer to recover,” we are '
         'assuming that male athletes are taking the right amount of time. But '
         'given what we are still learning about long-term contact sport '
         'participation and repeated concussions, maybe it isn’t that female '
         'athletes are taking longer—it’s that male athletes aren’t taking '
         'long enough. If we prematurely accept the premise that boys recover '
         'faster, we risk abandoning them to the perils of their own false '

         'ultrasound] and stimulate the brain in the place you want and '
         'modulate a circuit rather than damage it, is a really important '
         'proof of principle,” said Helen Mayberg, MD, of Emory University '
         'School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study. \xa0\n'
         'Ultrasound has long been used for imaging. When sound waves above '
         'the level that humans can hear (more than 20,000 hertz) are aimed at '
         'the body, some of the energy bounces back creating a picture of '
         'internal bodily structures. Focused ultrasound, or FUS, raises the '
         'energy level to accomplish other ends. Like using a magnifying glass '
         'to focus beams of light on a single point and burn a leaf, FUS '
         'concentrates as many as 1,000 sound waves on a specific target with '
         'precision and accuracy.\n'
         'First approved by the Federal Drug Administration in 2004 as a '
         'treatment for uterine fibroids, focused ultrasound has gained an '
         'increasing variety of potential uses, generating excitement among '
         'many doctors. “There are 18 ways, or mechanisms of action, by which '
         'focused ultrasound affects tissue. That fact creates the opportunity '
         'to treat a whole variety of medical disorders,” says Neal Kassell, '
         'MD, former co-chair of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia '
         'and founder and chairman of the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which '
         'seeks to speed the development and adoption of the technology.\n'
         'A decade ago, FUS was being investigated as a treatment for three '
         'diseases or disorders. Today that number stands at more than 90. '
         'Thus far, however, it has only been used in humans to target and '
         'destroy tissue with heat. In addition to uterine fibroids, it is '
         'approved for four other therapeutic uses in the United States. '
         'Prostate cancer was added to the list in 2015, although some '
         'urologists have been lukewarm about its use, emphasizing in the '
         'Journal of the American Medical Association in 2016 that the '
         'long-term efficacy is not yet proven. In the brain, the FDA approved '
         'its use as an ablation treatment (removing tissue) for essential '
         'tremor in 2016. (In Europe, it’s more widely used.)\n'
         'Howard Eisenberg, professor and chief of neurosurgery at the '
         'University of Maryland School of Medicine, participated in the '
         'clinical studies of FUS as an ablative treatment for essential '
         'tremor and Parkinson’s disease, targeting different brain areas for '
         'each disorder. He has found that patients like the technology '
         'because it’s less invasive than deep brain stimulation, which '
         'requires surgery to implant an electrode. “It’s not surgery really,” '
         'says Eisenberg. In addition, because FUS is so precise, says '
         'Eisenberg, “you can sculpt the lesion, you might make three '
         'ablations all close to each other.”\n'
         'Comparatively speaking, neuromodulation, which entails altering '
         'electrical and chemical signaling in brain circuits, requires lower '
         'doses of energy that are delivered as intermittent pulses, and is '
         'relatively far down the list of possible uses for FUS in the brain. '
         '“It’s a frontier approach,” says Eisenberg, who is more excited '
         'about using FUS to open the blood brain barrier for drug delivery '
         'But if the technique can be perfected as a method of brain '
         'stimulation it will open a new range of possibilities. It can be '
         'aimed more precisely—on the order of millimeters rather than '
         'centimeters—than transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). And it can '
         'go deeper into the brain. “I think the first opportunity is on the '
         'diagnostic side,” said Kubanek. “Disease circuitry might be variable '
         'across patients. If we can specifically stimulate regions deep in '
         'the brain and measure the reduction of tremor, that would [tell us '
         'that region is] involved in that behavior.” The next step would be '
         'to apply focused ultrasound as a method of brain stimulation for a '
         'variety of mental health and neurodegenerative disorders like '
         'Alzheimer’s. \xa0\n'
         'Like Kubanek, Seung-Schik Yoo, professor of radiology at Harvard '
         'Medical School and director of the neuromodulation lab at Brigham '
         'and Women’s Hospital, demonstrated successful brain stimulation '
         'using FUS at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. In sheep, Yoo and '
         'his colleagues showed that FUS could both excite and inhibit brain '
         'activity without apparent harm. But Yoo’s primary aim was to develop '
         'a wearable transcranial FUS system. His team created a small '
         'apparatus weighing only a quarter of a pound that could be worn by '
         'the sheep, whose cranial structure is similar to humans. The system '
         'consisted of a focused ultrasound transducer to generate the signal, '
         'an optical tracker and an applicator to hold the transducer over the '
         'head via an implanted pedestal. (In humans, they plan to do away '
         'with the need for implantation.) The group also developed a computer '
         'algorithm capable of predicting the intensity and location of the '
         'acoustic focus, which Yoo likened to an area the size of a large '
         'piece of orzo pasta.\n'
         '\xa0“The tools themselves are really changing the face of what’s '
         'possible,” Mayberg says. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could tune '
         '[brain circuitry] with ultrasound and don’t have to open the brain?” '
         'she says. That would avoid surgery and the need for periodically '
         'changing batteries. “You could wear a device like the sheep,” she '
         'adds. “We can start to dream about some innovations that are based '
         'on exquisite neuroscience.”\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Why Are Some People More Creative Than Others?',
 'text': 'The following essay is reprinted with permission from\xa0The '
         'Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\n'
         'Creativity is often defined as the ability to come up with new and '
         'useful ideas. Like intelligence, it can be considered a trait that '
         'everyone—not just creative “geniuses” like Picasso and Steve '
         'Jobs—possesses in some capacity.\n'
         'It’s not just your ability to draw a picture or design a product. We '
         'all need to think creatively in our daily lives, whether it’s '
         'figuring out how to make dinner using leftovers or fashioning a '
         'Halloween costume out of clothes in your closet. Creative tasks '
         'range from what researchers call\xa0“little-c” creativity\xa0– '
         'making a website, crafting a birthday present or coming up with a '
         'funny joke—to\xa0“Big-C” creativity: writing a speech, composing a '
         'poem or designing a scientific experiment.\n'
         'Psychology and neuroscience researchers have started to identify '
         'thinking processes and brain regions involved with creativity. '
         'Recent evidence suggests that creativity involves\xa0a complex '
         'interplay between spontaneous and controlled thinking\xa0– the '
         'ability to both spontaneously brainstorm ideas and deliberately '
         'evaluate them to determine whether they’ll actually work.\n'
         'Despite this progress, the answer to one question has remained '
         'particularly elusive: What makes some people more creative than '
         'others?\n'
         'In a new study, my colleagues and I examined whether a person’s '
         'creative thinking ability can be explained, in part, by a connection '
         'between three brain networks.\n'
         'In the study, we had 163 participants complete a classic test of '
         '“divergent thinking” called the alternate uses task, which asks '
         'people to think of new and unusual uses for objects. As they '
         'completed the test, they underwent fMRI scans, which measures blood '
         'flow to parts of the brain.\n'
         'The task assesses people’s ability to\xa0diverge\xa0from the common '
         'uses of an object. For example, in the study, we showed participants '
         'different objects on a screen, such as a gum wrapper or a sock, and '
         'asked to come up with creative ways to use them. Some ideas were '
         'more creative than others. For the sock, one participant suggested '
         'using it to warm your feet—the common use for a sock—while another '
         'participant suggested using it as a water filtration system.\n'
         'Importantly, we found that people who did better on this task also '
         'tended to report having more creative hobbies and achievements, '
         'which is\xa0consistent with previous studies\xa0showing that the '
         'task measures general creative thinking ability.\n'
         'After participants completed these creative thinking tasks in the '
         'fMRI, we measured functional connectivity between all brain '
         'regions—how much activity in one region correlated with activity in '
         'another region.\n'
         'We also ranked their ideas for originality: Common uses received '
         'lower scores (using a sock to warm your feet), while uncommon uses '
         'received higher scores (using a sock as a water filtration system).\n'
         'Then we correlated each person’s creativity score with all possible '
         'brain connections (approximately 35,000), and removed connections '
         'that, according to our analysis, didn’t correlate with creativity '
         'scores. The remaining connections constituted a “high-creative” '
         'network, a set of connections highly relevant to generating original '
         'ideas.\n'
         'Having defined the network, we wanted to see if someone with '
         'stronger connections in this high-creative network would score well '
         'on the tasks. So we measured the strength of a person’s connections '
         'in this network, and then used predictive modeling to test whether '
         'we could estimate a person’s creativity score.\n'
         'The models revealed a significant correlation between the predicted '
         'and observed creativity scores. In other words, we could estimate '
         'how creative a person’s ideas would be based on the strength of '
         'their connections in this network.\n'
         'We further tested whether we could predict creative thinking ability '
         'in three new samples of participants whose brain data were not used '
         'in building the network model. Across all samples, we found that we '
         'could predict—albeit modestly—a person’s creative ability based on '
         'the strength of their connections in this same network.\n'
         'Overall, people with stronger connections came up with better '
         'ideas.\n'
         'We found that the brain regions within the “high-creative” network '
         'belonged to three specific brain systems: the default, salience and '
         'executive networks.\n'
         'The\xa0default network\xa0is a set of brain regions that activate '
         'when people are engaged in spontaneous thinking, such as '
         'mind-wandering, daydreaming and imagining. This network may play a '
         'key role in idea generation or brainstorming—thinking of several '
         'possible solutions to a problem.\n'
         'The\xa0executive control network\xa0is a set of regions that '
         'activate when people need to focus or control their thought '
         'processes. This network may play a key role in idea evaluation or '
         'determining whether brainstormed ideas will actually work and '
         'modifying them to fit the creative goal.\n'
         'The\xa0salience network\xa0is a set of regions that acts as a '
         'switching mechanism between the default and executive networks. This '
         'network may play a key role in alternating between idea generation '
         'and idea evaluation.\n'
         'An interesting feature of these three networks is that they '
         'typically don’t get activated at the same time. For example, when '
         'the executive network is activated,\xa0the default network is '
         'usually deactivated. Our results suggest that creative people are '
         'better able to co-activate brain networks that usually work '
         'separately.\n'
         'Our findings indicate that the creative brain is “wired” differently '
         'and that creative people are better able to engage brain systems '
         'that don’t typically work together. Interestingly, the results are '
         'consistent with recent fMRI studies of professional artists, '
         'including\xa0jazz musicians improvising melodies,\xa0poets writing '
         'new lines of poetry\xa0and\xa0visual artists sketching ideas for a '
         'book cover.\n'
         'Future research is needed to determine whether these networks are '
         'malleable or relatively fixed. For example, does taking drawing '
         'classes lead to greater connectivity within these brain networks? Is '
         'it possible to boost general creative thinking ability by modifying '
         'network connections?\n'
         'For now, these questions remain unanswered. As researchers, we just '
         'need to engage our own creative networks to figure out how to answer '
         'them.\n'

 'text': 'Most toddlers who were exposed to Zika in the womb and born with '

         'according to the first report characterizing the longer-term health '
         'effects of prenatal exposure to the virus. These children often '
         'continue to have seizures as well as an inability to respond to '
         'noises in their surroundings or follow objects with their eyes, '
         'researchers found.\n'
         'The findings are based on follow-up exams of Brazilian kids born '
         'with smaller than normal heads, a birth defect called microcephaly. '
         'Earlier analyses suggested such infants would have serious '
         'developmental delays, but the new report, released Thursday by '
         'Brazilian and U.S. health officials, is the first to provide a '
         'detailed account of what challenges these kids will face as they '
         'grow up—and to confirm children born with Zika-related microcephaly '
         'will probably need lifelong care.\n'
         'The report comes from careful tracking of 19 babies born in 2015 and '
         '2016 who were diagnosed with microcephaly and had accompanying '
         'laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus. The children were all '
         'from northeastern Brazil, and the study found that at around ages 19 '
         'to 24 months the toddlers had conditions including an inability to '
         'sit independently, difficulties with sleeping and feeding, seizures, '
         'and hearing and vision problems. About 75 percent of them suffered '
         'from cerebral palsy. And the majority of the kids—three '
         'quarters—suffered from at least three of these issues. These '
         'children “have severe functional limitations and will require '
         'specialized care from clinicians and caregivers as they age,” the '
         'study says. Ten of the subjects were male and nine were female.\n'
         'Brazilian authorities produced the analysis in collaboration with '
         'the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published it '
         'Thursday in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Health '
         'authorities say the new findings will help shape how countries '
         'should prepare for the years ahead, and will underscore the '
         'importance of continuing to monitor children severely affected by '
         'the virus. “The findings may not be representative of all the babies '
         'whose mothers got exposed to Zika during pregnancy,” cautions Albert '
         'Ko, a Zika expert and professor of epidemiology and medicine at Yale '
         'University who was not involved in the study. “These cases are '
         'likely to be the worst of the worst because 70 to 80 percent of '
         'these kids had severe microcephaly—meaning their heads were more '
         'than three standard deviations smaller than the average infant head. '
         'The big remaining question is: How about all the babies that didn’t '
         'have this severe presentation?” he says.\n'
         'More developmental updates will be released in the coming years from '
         'Brazil and elsewhere. As of September 2017 almost 3,000 newborns had '
         'reportedly been born with microcephaly in Brazil, and 2,959 of them '
         'are being closely monitored. In the U.S. the latest numbers suggest '
         'more than 2,000 Zika-infected women have had babies. At least 98 of '
         'them were born with Zika-related birth defects; another 142 infants '
         'were born with such issues in the U.S. territories, where the virus '
         'has been much more common.\n'
         'The 19 children included in this particular study were part of a '
         'case-control investigation from selected areas of Brazil’s Paraíba '
         'State. One possible limitation of the findings, the study authors '
         'wrote, \xa0is that these infants had their blood collected between '
         'one and seven months after birth—so it is possible some of them '

         'womb.\n'
         'The study authors also cautioned the picture may be worse than they '
         'found; even though four of the 19 children appeared to be showing '
         'more typical development, that could be because they were '
         'misdiagnosed as having microcephaly or mistakenly found to have '

         'millions of years ago. Most of these viral remnants are inactive, '
         'but the latest research suggests that some evolved into genes that '
         'let cells communicate.\n'
         'A pair of papers\xa0published in\xa0Cell\xa0on January 11 suggest '
         'that the protein encoded by one such gene uses its virus-like '
         'structure to shuttle information between cells: a new form of '
         'cellular communication that may be key to long-term memory formation '
         'and other neurological functions.\n'
         'Two research groups came across the phenomenon independently while '
         'studying extracellular vesicles—pieces of cell membranes that pinch '
         'off into bubbles and float away from the cells. These vesicles '
         'circulate throughout the body, but little is known about their '
         'function. The teams, led by neuroscientist Jason Shepherd at the '
         'University of Utah in Salt Lake City and cell biologist Vivian '
         'Budnik at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in '
         'Worcester, looked at mice and flies (Drosophila melanogaster), '
         'respectively.\n'
         'The researchers found that many of the extracellular vesicles '
         'released by neurons contain a gene called\xa0Arc, which helps '
         'neurons to build connections with one another. Mice engineered to '
         'lack\xa0Arc\xa0have problems forming long-term memories, and several '
         'human neurological disorders are linked to this gene.\n'
         'When Shepherd and Budnik analysed the genetic sequences of mouse and '
         'fly versions of\xa0Arc, they found that they were similar to that of '
         'a viral gene called\xa0gag. Retroviruses such as HIV use the Gag '
         'protein to assemble protective shells called capsids that transport '
         'the virus’s genetic material between cells during infection.\n'
         'When the researchers looked at the Arc protein under a '
         'high-resolution microscope, they found that it formed a similar '
         'capsid and carried the genetic instructions, or messenger RNA '
         '(mRNA), that encode Arc. The capsid was then wrapped in a piece of '
         'the cell membrane and released as an extracellular vesicle.\n'
         'No other non-viral protein has been shown to form capsids and '
         'shuttle mRNA between cells. “It’s groundbreaking,” says Clive '
         'Bramham, a neuroscientist at the University of Bergen in Norway.\n'
         'In flies, Budnik’s group found that motor neurons—which connect to '
         'muscle cells and tell them when to contract—produced vesicles '
         'containing\xa0Arc. Once the vesicles reached the muscle cells, they '
         'fused with those cells’ membranes, releasing the Arc protein and '
         'mRNA. It’s unclear what the muscle cell does with the protein and '
         'mRNA, but Budnik found that flies that lacked the gene formed fewer '
         'connections between neurons and muscles.\n'
         'Shepherd’s group found a similar phenomenon in neurons taken from '
         'mouse brains. Neurons that absorbed extracellular vesicles from '
         'other neurons would start using the Arc mRNA to produce the protein '
         'once they were stimulated to fire.\n'
         'Shepherd and Budnik think that the vesicles containing\xa0Arc\xa0'
         'play a part in helping neurons to form and break connections over '

 'name': 'Men with Autism May Misread Social Cues in Body Odor',
 'text': 'Men with autism respond differently to human odors — and the social '
         'signals that they contain — than do their neurotypical peers, '
         'according to a new study.\n'
         'The results suggest that men with autism misread social signals '
         'present in human odors — causing them to misinterpret others’ '
         'emotions.\n'
         'Human sweat contains chemicals believed to convey social and '
         'emotional information. For instance, when women smell sweat '
         'collected from men watching scary movies, they are more likely to '
         'describe faces with ambiguous expressions as fearful.\n'
         'In the new study, researchers exposed men to sweat collected from '
         'people who were skydiving. Unlike controls, men with autism do not '
         'show increased skin conductance, a measure of physiological arousal, '
         'to this ‘fear sweat.’ They are also more likely than controls to '
         'trust a mannequin that emits this scent.\n'
         '“I think this could be a meaningful aspect of impaired social '
         'interaction,” says lead investigator Noam Sobel, professor of '
         'neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, '
         'Israel. “Humans constantly engage in social chemo-signaling; we do '
         'this all the time, and it shapes our interactions,” he says. “And '
         'somehow these mechanisms work differently in autism.”\n'
         'Several studies have examined olfaction in people with autism. '
         'Researchers have found, for example, that children with autism '
         'inhale odors differently than their typical peers do, and some '
         'children with the condition may be particularly sensitive to '
         'smells.\n'
         'But there has been little work on how people with autism process the '
         'social information contained in body odors.\n'
         'The new paper is provocative because it suggests that the '
         'communication problems that accompany autism may extend to chemical '
         'forms, says Johannes Frasnelli, professor of anatomy at the '
         'University of Quebec at Trois-Rivières in Canada, who was not '
         'involved in the research.\n'
         'However, little is known about how people communicate through odors. '
         '“I think what this paper does is it generates hypotheses; it looks '
         'at the problem from a very interesting angle,” Frasnelli says. The '
         'topic “definitely deserves more research,” he says.\n'
         'The smell of fear: \n'
         'Sobel and his colleagues began by assessing the basic olfactory '
         'skills of 16 men with autism and 18 controls. They asked the '
         'participants to sniff three samples of body odor, two of which were '
         'from the same person, and pick out the one that did not belong.\n'
         'The participants with autism performed just as well on this task as '
         'their peers did, suggesting that they are not impaired in their '
         'ability to detect and distinguish among odors.\n'
         'The researchers then asked 15 men with autism and 15 controls to '
         'rate sweat samples collected from skydivers. Both groups reported '
         'that the smell of this perspiration was more intense, less pleasant '
         'and connoted higher levels of fear than sweat collected from men who '
         'had been walking calmly.\n'
         'Despite the similarity of these ratings, however, the fear sweat '
         'prompted markedly different bodily reactions in the two groups of '
         'men. The controls showed a significant increase in skin conductance '
         'while smelling the fear sweat, but not the walking sweat. Men with '
         'autism, however, did not show an elevation in arousal.\n'
         'To assess how the chemical signals in fear sweat might influence the '
         'men’s behavior, Sobel’s team built two robotic mannequins, one that '
         'gave off fear sweat and another that emitted a control odor (sports '
         'sweat). The mannequins were also programmed to help the participants '
         'in a cognitive test, providing them with spoken hints to help them '
         'quickly locate and click on a target on a computer screen.\n'
         'Both mannequins gave advice that was correct 70 percent of the time. '
         'Still, the controls put more trust in the hints provided by the '
         'mannequin that emitted sports sweat than in those provided by the '
         'one that gave off the fear sweat; the opposite was true of the men '
         'with autism.\n'
         'The results were published in Nature Neuroscience on 27 November.\n'
         'Mixed signals: \n'
         'The results suggest that although men with autism can detect the '
         'chemical signals in fear sweat, they interpret and react to these '
         'signals differently than controls do.\n'
         'The study “really shed light on the fact that it’s not the explicit '
         'processing of odors that are impaired in autism, but the implicit '
         'processing of the social cues in odors,” says Bruno Wicker, a '
         'neuroscience researcher at the French National Center for Scientific '
         'Research and Aix-Marseille University in Marseille, France, who was '
         'not involved in the study.\n'
         'This distorted signal processing may be particularly problematic '
         'because it occurs largely without conscious awareness.\n'
         '“You can’t do anything to mitigate this wrong message,” Sobel says. '
         '“You’re unaware of getting a message at all, let alone that it’s '
         'wrong. So this obviously would pose a major obstacle and barrier to '
         'social interaction.”\n'
         'The underlying reason for these differences is unclear, but it may '
         'be that olfactory receptors in people with autism go awry. Because '
         'these receptors are located throughout the brain, the problem could '
         'derail multiple aspects of brain development, the researchers say.\n'

                'Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s\xa0',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Experimental Huntington’s Therapy Shows Promise in a Small Trial',
 'text': 'As the sun went down on a recent Friday, the hospital clinic buzzed '
         'with activity. “Loads of patients turned up without appointments,” '
         'says Sarah Tabrizi, a neurologist at University College London.\n'
         'It wasn’t just the typical post-holiday rush. Many rushed in, '
         'Tabrizi suspects, after hearing news last month about a potential '
         'new therapy for Huntington’s disease, a brain disorder that cripples '
         'the body and blurs speech and thinking, sometimes not too long after '
         'a person’s 30th birthday. Like other neurodegenerative disorders '
         'such as Lou Gehrig’s, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s has '
         'no cure. Over decades biotech companies have poured billions of '
         'dollars into developing and testing pharmaceuticals for these '
         'devastating conditions, only to unleash storms of disappointment. '
         'Yet in December a ray of something approximating hope poked through '
         'when a California company released preliminary findings from its '
         'small Huntington’s study.\n'
         'Results from this early-stage clinical trial have not yet been '
         'published or reported at medical meetings. But some researchers have '
         'growing confidence that the drug should work for Huntington’s and '
         'perhaps other diseases with clear genetic roots. The initial data '
         'showed enough promise to convince Roche to license the drug from '
         'California-based Ionis Pharmaceuticals, which sponsored the recent '
         'Huntington’s trial. The pharma giant paid Ionis $45 million for the '
         'right to conduct further studies and work with regulatory agencies '
         'to bring the experimental therapy to market.\n'
         'Huntington’s is heritable—a copy of the gene from either parent '
         'guarantees a person will develop the disease. Each case can be '
         'traced to a bunch of repeated code letters of DNA within a single '
         'gene called HTT. Brain cells translate that genomic gobbledygook '
         'into rogue proteins, which do bad things inside nerve cells and '
         'eventually trigger symptoms, such as involuntary movements. Most '
         'experimental drugs target the cells’ misdeeds. But designing drugs '
         'gets tricky if researchers are not sure which, if any, of those '
         'problems actually drives disease, and which act earlier or later in '
         'the process.\n'
         'With Ionis’s approach, none of that matters. The drug in question '
         'tries to keep cells from making the mutant protein in the first '
         'place. DNA in the cell nucleus normally consists of a twisted double '
         'strand of molecules called nucleotides. Ionis’s drug, called an '
         'antisense oligonucleotide, is a snippet of single-stranded DNA. It '
         'halts an intermediate step in the protein-making process by binding '
         'to genetic material known as RNA, blocking the issuing of final '
         'instructions for making the Htt protein.\n'
         'The strategy of using designer DNA drugs to shut down production of '
         'disease-causing genes in neurodegenerative disorders has been in the '
         'making for more than a decade. It was pioneered by Don Cleveland, a '
         'neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, and '
         'Richard Smith director of the Center for Neurologic Study. A '
         'consultant for Ionis, Cleveland won a 2018 $3-million Breakthrough '
         'Prize in Life Sciences for his antisense work, which showed reducing '
         'mutant protein levels can slow disease in laboratory animals used to '
         'study Huntington’s and Lou Gehrig’s diseases.\n'
         'The recent human trial, led by Tabrizi, enrolled 46 people with '
         'early Huntington’s disease at nine sites in the U.K., Germany and '
         'Canada. The researchers injected either the antisense drug or a '
         'placebo into the study participants’ spinal fluid—a 20-minute '
         'procedure similar to those that deliver epidural anesthesia to women '
         'in labor. In the Huntington’s trial participants received three '
         'months of injections delivered at four-week intervals and returned '
         'to the lab for tests three to four months after the final dose.\n'
         'Despite promising results from past studies in rodents and nonhuman '
         'primates, testing the antisense strategy in people carried big '
         'unknowns. “We didn’t know if [the drug] would get into the brain,” '
         'Tabrizi says. “We didn’t know if we’d be able to switch off the HTT '
         'message. We didn’t know if it would be safe.”\n'
         'After collecting the participants’ spinal fluid and tallying final '
         'measurements of mutant Htt, the results were clear: Antisense '
         'therapy was not only safe and well tolerated, it reduced the '
         'targeted disease-causing protein.\n'
         'Neuroscientist John Hardy, a University College London colleague not '
         'involved in the study, found the results a complete surprise. “It’s '
         'all very well to give antisense therapies to a mouse with a '
         '300-milligram brain,” he says. “But to give spinal fluid injections '
         '[in people] and have it spread through the brain to an extent great '
         'enough to knock down gene expression….” He adds: “Three or four '
         'years ago, I would not have expected that to work, and yet it does. '
         'This could be a whole new generally applicable type of drug.” \n'
         'Part of Hardy’s excitement stems from the recent success of '
         'antisense drugs in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an inherited '
         'neuromuscular disorder in children. Two SMA trials were stopped in '
         '2016 after analyses showed kids taking the drug exhibited motor '
         'improvements so dramatic, regulators deemed it unethical to keep '
         'some participants on the placebo. The U.S. Food and Drug '
         'Administration approved the SMA drug, nusinersen, later that year.\n'
         'Because antisense drugs are built from the same set of core '
         'elements—chemical modifications that stabilize a chain of '
         'nucleotides and help deliver them inside cells—they can be developed '
         'more quickly than traditional protein-targeting therapies. “Once we '
         'establish the basic principles, we can apply those for the next drug '
         'and the next,” says Frank Bennett, Ionis’s senior vice president of '
         'research. “It really streamlines the development process.” In '
         'addition to Huntington’s, Ionis has begun testing antisense '
         'therapies for certain types of Lou Gehrig’s and Alzheimer’s—and more '
         'trials are in the planning stages.\n'
         'The recent Huntington’s success “is the first step in a journey,” '
         'Tabrizi says. Next up: a larger trial in hundreds of patients to see '
         'if lowering mutant Htt protein slows progression of the disease, '
         'then a trial in healthy people who carry the mutant HTT gene to see '
         'if antisense treatments could prevent Huntington’s altogether.\n',

 'text': 'Fossil records can tell us a lot about our evolutionary past: what '
         'our ancestors looked like, how they walked, what they ate. But what '
         'bits of bone don’t typically reveal is why humans evolved the way we '
         'did—why, compared with all other known species, we wound up capable '
         'of such complex thought, emotion and behavior.\n'
         'A team of researchers has now used a novel technique to form a '
         'hypothesis on the origins of our rich cognitive abilities. They did '
         'so by profiling the chemicals buzzing around our brains. These '
         'compounds, known as neurotransmitters, are the signaling molecules '
         'responsible for key brain functions. Their research reveals that in '
         'comparison with other higher primates, our brains have unique '
         'neurotransmitter profiles that probably resulted in our enhanced '
         'cognition.\n'
         'The authors of the new study—a multicenter effort led by Kent State '
         'University anthropologists C. Owen Lovejoy and Mary Ann Raghanti '
         'and\xa0published January 22 in PNAS—began by measuring '
         'neurotransmitter levels in brain samples from humans, chimpanzees, '
         'gorillas, baboons and monkeys, all of whom had died of natural '
         'causes. Specifically, they tested levels in the striatum, a brain '
         'region involved in social behaviors and interactions. Compared with '
         'the other species tested, humans had markedly increased striatal '
         'dopamine activity. Among other functions, dopamine helps drive '
         'reward activity and social behaviors. In the striatum in particular '
         'it contributes to uniquely human abilities and behaviors like '
         'complicated social group formation and, in part, speech and '
         'language.\n'
         'Humans, gorillas and chimps also had elevated striatal serotonin, '
         'compared with other primates. Increased serotonin levels in the '
         'striatum are known to increase cognitive and social control and also '
         'reduce aggression whereas low levels are linked with underdeveloped '
         'social skills.\n'
         'Also in the mix is the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, higher levels '
         'of which are associated with aggression. Lovejoy and his colleagues '
         'found that gorillas and chimps have much higher levels of '
         'acetylcholine than do humans. “The high striatal serotonin shared by '
         'humans and great apes likely contributes to the cognitive '
         'flexibility required for complex social interactions,” Raghanti '
         'says. “The lower acetylcholine in humans corresponds to our '
         'decreased aggression, compared to most other apes. It’s a concert '
         'really.”\n'
         'Raghanti and Lovejoy believe the human brain’s neurochemical profile '
         'was shaped by natural selection due to the various reproductive and '
         'survival benefits it conferred. Our evolving chemical signature, '
         'they suggest, allowed us to outcompete other apes and early '
         'hominins, referring to the numerous humanlike species that arose '
         'after our split with chimpanzees over six million years ago.\n'
         'The team speculates humans’ elevated striatal dopamine levels in '
         'particular would have led to more advanced social behaviors and '
         'perhaps monogamy, both of which may have improved our offspring’s '
         'survival and benefitted our ancestors. They also feel that by '
         'enhancing social behaviors, a “dopamine-dominated striatum” '
         'personality type, as they call it, would have led to selection for '
         'increased brain size and also language.\n'
         'Clifford Jolly, an anthropologist at New York University who was not '
         'involved in the new research, believes the authors’ hypothesis is '
         'credible. “The suggestion that differences in [neurochemical '
         'profiles] are correlated with particular ape–human differences in '
         'temperament and behavior remains a hypothesis, although a '
         'strongly-founded one,” he says. “It’s certainly probable that the '
         'described striatal reorganization played an important role in the '
         'evolution of distinctive human behavior, especially the striking '
         'level of empathy with other humans that appears to be an innate '
         'characteristic of the species.”\n'
         'Previous research suggests our ability to cooperate and exhibit '
         'empathy—both thought to be critical to human success—relied in part '
         'on the large brains of our hominin ancestors, relative to body size; '
         'and that selection against aggression within early human populations '
         'allowed us to thrive. This is called the “self-domestication '
         'hypothesis.” In planning the new study Raghanti wanted to test '
         'whether or not a large brain was necessary for us to '
         'self-domesticate. And given its role in modulating social '
         'interactions, she and her colleagues decided the striatum would be a '
         'logical brain region to test.\n'
         'Based on the new findings, Raghanti believes it was our chemical '
         'signature that came first, which then allowed our brains to balloon. '
         '“Our findings provide a mechanism for how our lineage ended up with '
         'large brains [in the first place],” she says. And, as she points '
         'out, there is anatomical evidence supporting this chronology.\n'
         'Fossil records show our hominin lineage emerged before our brains '
         'began enlarging. \xa0By the time our crania began expanding, our '
         'canine teeth—our “fangs”—had already begun shrinking significantly '
         'in size. Raghanti says our smaller canines can be seen as “social '
         'teeth.” Long used by sparring males vying for female attention, a '
         'shortening of lethal protuberance signals increased civility among '
         'early hominins. “A reduction in the size of the canine indicates '
         'decreased aggression, which would be consistent with the '
         'neurochemical profile that we see in modern humans,” she says. '
         'Importantly, this could have occurred without any enlargement of the '
         'brain.”\n'

 'fileType': 'article',

 'text': 'Noninvasive brain stimulation is having its heyday, as scientists '
         'and hobbyists alike look for ways to change the activity of neurons '
         'without cutting into the brain and implanting electrodes. One '
         'popular set of techniques, called transcranial electrical '
         'stimulation (TES), delivers electrical current via electrodes stuck '
         'to the scalp, typically above the target brain area. In recent years '
         'a number of studies have attributed wide-ranging benefits to TES '
         'including enhancing memory, improving math skills, alleviating '
         'depression and even speeding recovery from stroke. Such results have '
         'also spawned a cottage industry providing commercial TES kits for '
         'DIY brain hackers seeking to boost their mind power.\n'
         'But little is known about how TES actually interacts with the brain, '
         'and some studies have raised serious doubts about the effectiveness '
         'of these techniques. A study published on February 2 in Nature '
         'Communications ups the ante, reporting that conventional TES '
         'techniques do not deliver enough current to activate brain circuits '
         'or modulate brain rhythms. The electrical currents mostly fizzle out '
         'as they pass through the scalp and skull. “Anybody who has published '
         'a positive effect in this field is probably\xa0 not going to like '
         'our paper,” says György Buzsáki, a neuroscientist at New York '
         'University School of Medicine and a senior author of the study.\n'
         'The mechanisms behind TES have remained mysterious, in part because '
         'without penetrating the skull, researchers cannot measure neural '
         'responses while they apply stimulation. Conventional TES methods '
         'produce electrical noise that swamps any brain activity detected on '
         'the scalp.\n'
         'To get around this problem, Buzsáki’s team first implanted '
         'electrodes inside the brains of rats and measured neural activity '
         'while they applied TES externally. By varying the stimulation '
         'parameters, they found the minimum electric field strength needed to '
         'trigger neuronal firing or to alter brain rhythms.\n'
         'Next, the researchers wanted to figure out how much current they '
         'needed to apply to the human scalp to produce those electrical '
         'fields inside the brain. But these invasive experiments cannot be '
         'done in people, so Buzsáki’s team went with the next best thing: '
         'human cadavers. By implanting recording electrodes inside the '
         'cadavers’ brains and applying TES externally, the researchers found '
         'that they needed to zap the scalp with about 4 to 6 milliamperes of '
         'current—well above typical current levels.\n'
         'Normally, TES practitioners avoid currents above 2 mA, because these '
         'induce side effects such as tingling, dizziness, unpleasant tastes, '
         'and illusory sights and sounds—the result of current entering soft '
         'tissues such as the eyes, ears and facial nerves, which offer less '
         'resistance than the skull. In fact, in both rats and human cadavers, '
         'Buzsáki’s team found about 75 percent of currents applied to the '
         'scalp never reach the brain, but instead are taken up by the skull, '
         'scalp and other external tissues.\n'
         'The findings resonate with skeptics of these techniques including '
         'Jared Horvath, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in '
         'Australia. In a 2015 meta-analysis Horvath rounded up about 400 '
         'publications that applied tDCS—(a version of TES that uses direct '
         'current) and reportedly influenced some aspect of cognition or '
         'behavior. When he pooled studies, his team found that although '
         'individual papers reported certain benefits (such as reduced '
         'reaction time or increased accuracy on a task), no reliable effects '
         'could be identified across studies. “Now, finally, we have hard data '
         'showing what many people have suspected all along: that tDCS simply '
         'is not getting into the brain,” Horvath says.\n'
         'To deliver the higher currents needed to get the job done, Antal '
         'Berényi, senior author on the new study and a neuroscientist at the '
         'University of Szeged in Hungary, developed a new TES system. Instead '
         'of using only one pair of stimulating electrodes, the design splits '
         'the work among six electrode pairs that each deliver a fraction of '
         'the desired current in rapid pulses that overlap and add up inside '
         'their target neurons. Tests in healthy volunteers showed this setup '
         'reduced the side effects associated with delivering higher currents. '
         'With more refinement and even more electrodes, Buzsáki hopes they '
         'can eventually eliminate the unwanted sensations.\n'
         'Some researchers aren’t ready to give up on traditional TES. '
         'Buzsáki’s team found conventional protocols lack sufficient current '
         'to directly influence brain circuits, but their study focused on '
         'what happened immediately following stimulating pulses. “Most TES '
         'approaches apply stimulation for tens of minutes,” notes Marom '
         'Bikson, a biomedical engineer at The City College of New York who '
         'was not involved with the study. Bikson suggests current TES '
         'practices could still exert subtle effects on neurons that '
         'accumulate over time to modulate brain function.\n'
         'Buzsáki acknowledges there are many possible routes by which '
         'conventional TES could alter neural activity indirectly or over '
         'longer time scales. One obvious candidate is the placebo '
         'effect—people improve because they believe the treatment works. But '
         'there may also be other explanations: Stimulating nerves on the '
         'scalp could send signals back to the brain or influence circulation. '
         'Or other types of cells besides neurons might pick up electrical '
         'fields and gradually alter brain function. Hard evidence, however, '
         'is lacking to prove most of these theories, Buzsáki notes. “I think '
         'the game now is to throw the ball back to those who claim there are '
         'positive effects and have them explain, if necessary, how it '
         'happens,” he says.\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': "Go Figure: Why Olympic Ice Skaters Don't Fall Flat on Their Faces",
 'text': 'Watching a fellow human jump into the air, spin three times and land '
         'on a thin piece of steel—all the while balancing on slippery ice—is '
         'an awe-inspiring experience. \n'
         'Figure skaters execute their routines so elegantly, they make it '
         'look easy—an illusion that quickly dissolves with our own trepid '
         'first step in an ice rink. Clinging to the side walls for dear life, '
         'feet stinging from the awkward display of ice walking, first-time '
         'ice skaters can barely skate in a straight line, let alone balance '
         'on one foot. Although it may seem Olympic figure skaters have '
         'befriended the ice gods and coaxed the laws of physics to work in '
         'their favor, what they have really done is rewire their brains to '
         'suppress their reflexes.\n'
         'If one tilts one’s head backward far enough, the body’s reflexes '
         'will kick in. Neurons that are responsible for firing when the brain '
         'senses the body is off-balance will set off a cascade of signals '
         'from the inner ear to the brain stem, then to the spinal cord and '
         'finally to the muscles that tell the body to lurch forward for the '
         'save. In sports like figure skating, the body is frequently in such '
         'unlikely positions. So how do skaters convince their brains that '
         'it’s totally okay the body is halfway to a face-plant?\n'
         'According to researchers, practice can lead to new maps of neurons '
         'in the cerebellum, an area in the back of the brain. So when the '
         'skater moves into a position anticipated by the cerebellum, it fires '
         'neurons to cancel out reflex signals that would interfere with the '
         'desired movement. If someone is slipping on ice and someone else is '
         'deliberately jumping, “they might be moving through the world in '
         'exactly the same way,” says Kathleen Cullen, a neuroscientist at '
         'John Hopkins University who in 2015 showed this brain mechanism in '
         'an experiment with monkeys. In one case, you want your reflexes to '
         'work; in the other, you don’t. The brain learns to quell reflexes '
         'when there’s a match between what it expects and what actually '
         'happens, she says.\n'
         'Skaters are also masters at avoiding dizziness. Here again, their '
         'brains have learned to subdue a reflex—this time in the eyes. As we '
         'move about the world, our eyes automatically move to compensate for '
         'slight head movements so we can stare at the same point in space. '
         'Normally, if we spin around in an office chair and suddenly stop, we '
         'feel like we’re still moving. That’s because fluid in the inner ear '
         'responsible for detecting movement continues to whirl around due to '
         'inertia, making your brain think it’s still in motion. Because your '
         'eyes continue moving to correct your view, you feel dizzy. According '
         'to Cullen, what a skater’s brain learns to do—through a similar '
         'mechanism in the cerebellum—is to ignore the false sense of motion '
         'at the end of a spin and greatly reduce that eye reflex.\n'
         'Training the brain takes time, and that’s why “it’s only practice '
         'that makes perfect,” says Rui Costa, a neuroscientist at Columbia '
         'University’s Zuckerman Institute who also studies the neuroscience '
         'of movement. When you look at how seamless most of these routines '
         'are, he says, “I mean, it’s just amazing.” For proof that the brain '
         'is continuously working and calibrating itself to help the body '
         'adapt to new motions and environments, just step out of the rink '
         'after some time skating. The ground will feel weird, as if your '
         'brain expects it to be made of ice.\n',

 'text': 'In Harry Potter, the young wizard is given a piece of parchment '
         'called the Marauder’s map on which is a detailed layout of Hogwarts '
         'School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The magical map reveals the '

         'ink footsteps. In the hippocampus—a small horseshoe-shaped area of '
         'mammalian brains—there is a kind of Marauder’s map, which keeps '
         'track of other individuals’ movements.\n'
         'Two new studies published last week in Science show the hippocampus '
         'is not only responsible for figuring out an animal’s own position in '
         'space—something previously known—but also that of others. This '

         'of humans in the middle of the field—players are really good at not '
         'bumping into one another.\n'
         'In 1971 John O’Keefe, a neuroscientist at University College London '
         '(U.C.L.), and his student Jonathan Dostrovsky discovered “place '
         'cells”—neurons in the hippocampus that fire when an animal goes to a '
         'specific spot in space. This finding earned O’Keefe a Nobel Prize in '
         '2014. But until recently research had only looked at how the brain '
         'maps an animal’s own position.\n'
         'Being able to map where others are in space, “is important for any '
         'kind of social interactions [such as] courtship, coordinated hunting '
         '[and] monitoring the position of predators or prey,” says Nachum '
         'Ulanovsky, a neurobiologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in '
         'Israel and senior author of one of the studies. “Here, in one bang, '
         'we had two studies in two different species of mammals showing [how '
         'the brain does this] for the first time.”\n'
         'Ulanovsky and his team trained four pairs of Egyptian fruit bats to '
         'fly to and from a set of raised balls in a tiny room. Each pair '
         'began perched on a “start” ball. The alpha bat was trained to fly '
         'across the room to either ball and back whereas the other male was '
         'trained to stay still and observe. Soon the observer bat realized '
         'that if it flew the same path as the other bat, it would receive '
         'some delicious banana mush. Using tiny implanted electrodes, the '
         'researchers recorded the activity of neurons in the observing bat’s '
         'hippocampus as it stood still and watched the alpha as well as while '
         'it traced a similar path across the room.* They found that 18 '
         'percent of the 378 neurons they recorded fired when the bat was '
         'watching the alpha. They named these neurons “social place cells.” '
         'Whereas some of these only fired in response to perceiving the '
         'positions of the alpha bat, others also fired when the observer bat '
         'itself moved, meaning they also functioned as typical place cells.\n'
         'The hippocampus has long been known to be involved in navigation and '
         'memory—and it is one of the first regions to be affected by '
         'Alzheimer’s disease. But recent research had suggested the '
         'hippocampus might also play a role in social interactions.\n'
         'Ulanovsky wanted to test if these neurons were specifically '
         'responding to a social cue. His team conducted the same experiments, '
         'except they replaced the alpha bat with a similar size plastic '
         'football or cube. They manually moved the objects to and from the '
         'start position to the two balls across the room and again trained '
         'the bat to mimic the trajectory. They found the observer bat’s '
         'neurons fired at different times when it watched the two moving '
         'objects rather than when it watched the alpha bat.\n'
         '“I think it’s an exciting finding, definitely, because it moves the '
         'focus for the hippocampus a little bit away from just representing '
         'self-location,” says Edvard Moser, a neuroscientist at the Norwegian '
         'University of Science and Technology. Moser and his wife at the '
         'time, May-Britt Moser, discovered another type of navigational '
         'neuron called a grid cell, for which they shared the Nobel Prize '
         'with O’Keefe. But, Edvard Moser adds, social place cells may not '
         'necessarily be confined to their role of firing in “social” '
         'situations. “I think social cognition is just one example of many '
         'things that can be represented in the hippocampus.”\n'
         'Thousands of miles away, Shigeyoshi Fujisawa, a neuroscientist at '
         'the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan independently performed a '
         'similar experiment with a different social creature. “People think '
         'place cells are like a map in the brain, but if this is actually a '
         'map, it should be used for not only [one’s own position] but for '
         'plotting other information,” Fujisawa says—for example, tracking '
         'other animals and having better social interactions.\n'
         'His team similarly had one thirsty rat observe a demonstrator rat '
         'navigate a T-shaped maze. In two separate experiments they trained '
         'the observer to go to either the same or opposite side of the '
         'demonstrator in order to receive a water reward. But to know where '
         'the reward was located, the observer had to pay attention to where '
         'the demonstrator rat went. As the observer watched the other rat '
         'move through the maze, the researchers measured brain activity in '
         'its hippocampus via implanted electrodes.\n'
         'Place cells can also fire based on where the animal intends to go. '
         'But their experiment helped differentiate those neurons from the '
         'ones that fired in response to observing another rat’s movements. If '
         'the observer rat was trained to know the water would be waiting for '
         'it at the opposite side of the demonstrator, its goal-oriented '
         'neurons would not be firing when observing the demonstrator scurry '
         'the other way.\n'
         'The researchers found 85 percent of the more than 1,000 place cells '
         'they studied also fired in response to the other rat’s position. '
         'Fujisawa and his team proposed the hippocampus maps out space in '
         'different ways that encode the position of the animal itself, the '
         'locations of other animals or both together. “As long as the animal '
         'cares [about] other animals or objects, I think there is a '
         'representation,” Fujisawa says. He doesn’t necessarily think it has '
         'to be a response to a social situation.\n'
         'Kate Jeffery, a neuroscientist at U.C.L. who was not part of either '
         'study, found the results interesting. She hopes subsequent '
         'experiments will be able to parse the subtle description between '
         'these neurons firing in response to a “social” cue or something else '
         'entirely. “It might just be something that is directing the '
         'attention of the animal to that point in space,” she suggests. “What '
         'we don’t know is, is it that this rat cares about where that rat is '
         'or does it just care about the place?”\n'
         'There are other unknowns, such as what would happen if the rats and '
         'the bats were placed in the same room. Would each species care '
         'enough about the other to cause brain sparks to fly? And is this '
         'behavior unique to rats and bats or is it generalizable to all '
         'mammals? “At least to me,” Moser says, “it seems quite likely that '
         'if it is present both in rats and in bats, it’s very likely that it '
         'exists across most or many mammals.”\n'

         'The Brain Trauma Indicator measures blood plasma levels of the '
         'UCH-L1, a protein scientists believe helps dispose of cellular waste '
         'in the brain, and GFAP, a structural protein found in non-neuronal '
         'cells called astrocytes. Both are released at elevated levels '
         'following a concussion or other injury that damages nerve fibers, '
         'and both can be detected within 20 minutes of a head injury '
         '(although it may take longer for doctors and patients to get the '
         'results from a lab).\n'
         'Concussions are notoriously difficult to diagnose, and patients '
         'suspected of having them are typically assessed by a doctor using '
         'the Glasgow Coma Scale—a series of physical tests for determining '
         'the level of consciousness—followed by a computed tomography (CT) '
         'head scan for brain abnormalities. CT scans are expensive, however, '
         'and many patients suspected of having traumatic brain injuries do '
         'not exhibit signs of visible damage when scanned. The blood test '
         'would provide hospitals and clinicians with a relatively quick '
         'screening tool to help them decide whether a CT scan would be likely '
         'to pick up any brain injury.\n'
         'The FDA authorized marketing the Brain Trauma Indicator after '
         'examining data from a clinical study of nearly 2,000 blood samples '
         'from patients with suspected concussions. From that data, the agency '
         'concluded the test can predict the absence of lesions on a CT scan '
         'with an accuracy of 99.5 percent, making it reliable enough to rule '
         'out the need for a scan in at least one third of the patients.\n'
         'Yet Zetterberg, who has been identifying biomarkers associated with '
         'brain injury and other neurological disorders in his lab, questions '
         'the usefulness of UCH-L1 as a concussion biomarker, and says his own '
         "testing has found it unreliable. “It's very important to look at the "
         'timing of the sample,” he says. “UCH-L1 might work at early time '
         'points, but if a sample is collected two to three days after an '
         'injury, perhaps other markers would be better.”\n'
         'Joseph Fins, a professor of medicine and medical ethics at Weill '
         'Cornell Medical Center, applauds the approval and says, “This test '
         'is an advance for triaging CT scans.” But he cautions it may not '
         'capture all minor concussions—like those that do not produce '
         'structural changes in the brain.“A negative blood test means that '
         'proteins were not released—not necessarily that there was not a mild '
         'concussion,” he says. “If it’s assumed that a patient did not have a '
         'concussion because the test is negative, and then the patient '
         'resumes the sporting activity, the effects of the next head injury '
         'can be augmented.”\n'
         "“It's promising that the FDA has approved something,” Zetterberg "
         'says. “But much more research is needed,” he adds—especially '
         'comparisons of different biomarkers at different time points after '
         'injury—to develop a more reliable blood test for concussion. CT scan '
         'abnormalities, he says, are just one aspect of this type of injury.\n'

 'name': 'Food for Thought: Was Cooking a Pivotal Step in Human Evolution?',
 'text': 'The shift to a cooked-food diet was a decisive point in human '
         'history. The main topic of debate is when, exactly, this change '
         'occurred.\n'
         'All known human societies eat cooked foods, and biologists generally '
         'agree cooking could have had major effects on how the human body '
         'evolved. For example, cooked foods tend to be softer than raw ones, '
         'so humans can eat them with smaller teeth and weaker jaws. Cooking '
         'also increases the energy they can get from the food they eat. '
         'Starchy potatoes and other tubers, eaten by people across the world, '
         'are barely digestible when raw. Moreover, when humans try to eat '
         'more like chimpanzees and other primates, we cannot extract enough '
         'calories to live healthily. Up to 50 percent of women who '
         'exclusively eat raw foods develop amenorrhea, or lack of '
         'menstruation, a sign the body does not have enough energy to support '
         'a pregnancy—a big problem from an evolutionary perspective.\n'
         'Such evidence suggests modern humans are biologically dependent on '
         'cooking. But at what point in our evolutionary history was this '
         'strange new practice adopted? Some researchers think cooking is a '
         'relatively recent innovation—at most 500,000 years old. Cooking '
         'requires control of fire, and there is not much archaeological '
         'evidence for hearths and purposefully built fires before this time.\n'
         'The archaeological record becomes increasingly fragile farther back '
         'in time, however, so others think fire may have been controlled much '
         'earlier. Anthropologist Richard Wrangham has proposed cooking arose '
         'before 1.8 million years ago, an invention of our evolutionary '
         'ancestors. If the custom emerged this early, it could explain a '
         'defining feature of our species: the increase in brain size that '
         'occurred around this time.\n'
         'What is the connection between cooking and brains? Understanding how '
         'and why our brains got so big has been a major puzzle because such a '
         'brain is metabolically expensive. In fact, the brain needs more '
         'energy for its size than any other organ. Although it might seem '
         'being smarter is always better, having a big brain exerts a high '
         'toll. Ancestral humans may have compensated for this energy cost by '
         'cooking food.\n'
         'Like all ideas about human evolution, the cooking hypothesis can '
         'only be tested indirectly—without a time machine we cannot know '
         'exactly what happened in our evolutionary history. But there are '
         'several converging pieces of evidence that support Wrangham’s '
         'cooking hypothesis.\n'
         'Fossils show the teeth and digestive tract\xa0of Homo erectus '
         'decreased in size around the same time brain size increased. This '
         'evidence likely means our ancestors started eating softer, '
         'higher-quality foods (although not necessarily cooked). New '
         'archaeological research has also continued to push back the earliest '
         'known date for the control of fire. For example, traces of '
         'purposeful fire at Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa have been dated '
         'at more than a million years old. Recent studies further suggest '
         'humans have genetic adaptions for eating cooked foods—some of which '
         'are old, at least predating our split from Neandertals. Finally, '
         'some of my own work, with psychologist Felix Warneken, has shown '
         'chimpanzees possess many of the foundational cognitive capacities '
         'needed to start cooking—such as a preference for cooked food, '
         'patience to wait for foods to be cooked and the capacity to plan for '
         'and transport foods to a cooking site. These data mean ancestral '
         'humans likely shared the same abilities, and could have started '
         'cooking rapidly after gaining the ability to control fire.\n'
         'These converging pieces of evidence point to an earlier date for the '
         'adoption of a cooked diet, in line with Wrangham’s proposed time '
         'line. But many exciting questions remain open. How much of these '
         'changes were due to eating cooked foods specifically, versus the '
         'increased use of other processing techniques such as pounding or '
         'cutting foods? Did the adoption of cooking—generally a communal '
         'process in humans—require changes in our social behavior, given that '
         'other apes rarely share food? Are there other ways to grow a big '
         'brain? Answering these questions will continue to shed new light on '
         'human health, human psychology and the origins of our species.\n',

                'genome sequences that are nearly identical across vertebrates',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': '“Dark Matter” DNA Influences Brain Development',
 'text': "A puzzle posed by segments of 'dark matter' in genomes—long, winding "
         'strands of DNA with no obvious functions—has teased scientists for '
         'more than a decade. Now, a team has finally solved the riddle.\n'
         'The conundrum has centred on DNA sequences that do not encode '
         'proteins, and yet remain identical across a broad range of animals. '
         'By deleting some of these ‘ultraconserved elements’, researchers '
         'have found that these sequences guide brain development by '
         'fine-tuning the expression of protein-coding genes.\n'
         'The results, published on January 18 in\xa0Cell, might help '
         'researchers to better understand neurological diseases such as '
         'Alzheimer’s. They also validate the hypotheses of scientists who '
         'have speculated that all ultraconserved elements are vital to '
         'life—despite the fact that researchers knew very little about their '
         'functions.\n'
         '“People told us we should have waited to publish until we knew what '
         'they did. Now I’m like, dude, it took 14 years to figure this out,” '
         'says Gill Bejerano, a genomicist at Stanford University in '
         'California, who described ultraconserved elements in 2004.\n'
         'Bejerano and his colleagues originally noticed ultraconserved '
         'elements when they compared the human genome to those of mice, rats '
         'and chickens, and found 481 stretches of DNA that were incredibly '
         'similar across the species. That was surprising, because DNA mutates '
         'from generation to generation—and these animal lineages have been '
         'evolving independently for up to 200 million years.\n'
         'Genes that encode proteins tend to have relatively few mutations '
         'because if those changes disrupt the corresponding protein and the '
         "animal dies before reproducing, the mutated gene isn't passed down "
         'to offspring. On the basis of this logic, some genomicists suspected '
         'that natural selection had similarly weeded out mutations in '
         'ultraconserved regions. Even though the sequences do not encode '
         'proteins, they thought, their functions must be so vital that they '
         'cannot tolerate imperfection.\n'
         'But this hypothesis hit a road block in 2007, when a team reported '
         'knocking out four ultraconserved elements in mice—and found that the '
         'animals looked fine and reproduced normally. “That was '
         'shocking—those mice should have been dead,” says Diane Dickel, a '
         'genomicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in '
         'California, and first author of the study in\xa0Cell.\n'
         'Dickel and her colleagues revisited the problem using the '
         'gene-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9. In mice, they deleted four '
         'ultraconserved elements—individually and in various '
         'combinations—that lie within regions of DNA that also contain genes '
         'important in brain development. Again, the mice looked okay. But '
         'when the investigators dissected the rodents’ brains, they '
         'discovered abnormalities.\n'
         'Mice lacking certain sequences had abnormally low numbers of brain '
         'cells that have been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer’s '
         'disease. And those with another ultraconserved element edited out '
         'had abnormalities in a part of the forebrain that’s involved in '
         'memory formation, as well as epilepsy. “Normally it looks like a '
         'blade, but in these mice, the blade was squiggly,” says Dickel.\n'
         'She suggests that the resulting cognitive defects would endanger '
         'mice in the wild. Therefore, variations in these ultraconserved '
         'regions would not spread through a population, because afflicted '
         'individuals would be less successful at reproducing than those who '
         'were unaffected.\n'
         'Future studies might explore whether people with Alzheimer’s '
         'disease, dementia, epilepsy or other neurological disorders have '
         'mutations in these overlooked non-coding sequences. Although the '
         'functions of many other ultraconserved sequences remain unknown, '
         'Bejerano feels confident that they, too, will prove essential. But '
         'he remains perplexed by the level of conservation—up to 100%—in some '
         'of the sequences because biology often tolerates minor variations. '

 'text': 'The observation that the human brain churns out new neurons '
         'throughout life is one of the biggest neuroscience discoveries of '
         'the past 20 years. The idea has captured immense popular and '
         'scientific interest—not least, because of hopes the brain’s '
         'regenerative capacity might be harnessed to boost cognition or to '
         'treat injury or disease. In nonhuman animals the continued '
         'production of new neurons has been linked to improved learning and '
         'memory, and possibly even mood regulation.\n'
         'But new findings in humans, reported online in Nature on Wednesday, '
         'pump the brakes on this idea. In a direct challenge to earlier '
         'studies, the authors report adults produce no new cells in the '
         'hippocampus, a key hub for processing memories.\n'
         'The study signals the latest volley in a debate over whether and to '
         'what extent the human brain produces new cells in adulthood. '
         'Scientists originally believed the brain stopped making neurons at '
         'or shortly after birth. But research in the 1960s began rolling back '
         'this dogma. Emerging techniques for labeling dividing cells revealed '
         'the birth of new neurons—a process called neurogenesis—in parts of '
         'the adult rat brain. Over the next few decades scientists discovered '
         'adult neurogenesis in other species, including birds, mice and '
         'monkeys. And in a 1998 landmark study researchers reported the '
         'phenomenon in the adult human hippocampus. Another major study in '
         '2013 corroborated those findings, estimating that about 1,400 '
         'hippocampal neurons are made daily in adult brains.\n'
         'The latest results push the pendulum back, raising eyebrows—even '
         'among the study researchers themselves. “We went into the '
         'hippocampus expecting to see many young neurons,” says senior author '
         'Arturo Alvarez-Buylla, a neuroscientist at the University of '
         'California, San Francisco. “We were surprised when we couldn’t find '
         'them.”\n'
         'Together with collaborators in China, Spain and Los Angeles, '
         'Alvarez-Buylla’s team examined 59 human brain samples ranging in age '
         'from fetal stages up to 77 years, obtained either postmortem or '
         'during brain surgery. The researchers sliced the tissue, then '
         'applied various antibodies that would signal the presence of young '
         'neurons as well as dividing cells, which give rise to new neurons. '
         'They found clear evidence of new neurons forming in prenatal and '
         'neonatal samples, but this fell off sharply within the first year of '
         'life. By ages seven and 13, only a few isolated young neurons '
         'appeared. In adult samples the researchers found no new neurons.\n'
         '“I feel vindicated,” says neuroscientist Pasko Rakic, a longtime, '
         'outspoken skeptic of neurogenesis in human adults. The Yale '
         'University researcher’s work suggests adult monkeys produce '
         'significantly fewer new neurons than do adult rodents. Rakic favors '
         'the idea that in primates, including humans, the absence or near '
         'absence of adult neurogenesis could help prevent disruptions to '
         'complex neural circuits. “This paper not only shows very convincing '
         'evidence of a lack of neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus '
         'but also shows that some of the evidence presented by other studies '
         'was not conclusive,” he says.\n'
         'Others not associated with the work interpret the findings in less '
         'stark terms. “It’s by far the best database that has ever been put '
         'together on cell turnover in the adult human hippocampus,” says '
         'Steven Goldman, a neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical '
         'Center and the University of Copenhagen. “The jury is still out '
         'about whether there are any new neurons being produced,” he says, '
         'adding that if there is neurogenesis, “it’s just not at the levels '
         'that have been presumed by many.” Goldman has had his doubts since '
         'the early 2000s, when his group isolated neural precursor cells from '
         'the adult human brain. These cells, although capable of producing '
         'neurons in a dish, were scarce in the brain. Goldman believes the '
         'latest study will help temper runaway expectations adult '
         'neurogenesis can be leveraged to treat patients’ memory or mood '
         'disorders.\n'
         'Yet others argue it is too early to change course based on the new '
         'results. Jonas Frisén, senior author of the 2013 study, stands by '
         'his original findings. “Since it is a rare phenomenon they are '
         'looking for, they may just not have looked carefully enough,” he '
         'says. The 1,400 neurons Frisén’s team estimated arise daily comprise '
         'a small fraction of the tens of millions of hippocampal cells. To '
         'find them, his group at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm '
         'studied people who were exposed to cold war nuclear bomb testing, '
         'and incorporated a radioactive carbon isotope into their dividing '
         'cells over many years. This cumulative measure, Frisén argues, can '
         'detect neurogenesis better than antibodies that label new neurons at '
         'a single time point.\n'
         'The U.C.S.F.-led group is “not really measuring neurogenesis in this '
         'study,” adds neuroscientist Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for '
         'Biological Studies. “Neurogenesis is a process, not an event. They '
         'just took dead tissue and looked at it at that moment in time.” In '
         'their seminal 1998 study Gage and his colleagues studied the brains '
         'of people who had received as part of cancer treatment an imaging '
         'molecule that became integrated into the DNA of actively dividing '
         'cells. Gage also believes the authors used overly restrictive '
         'criteria for counting neural progenitor cells, further reducing the '
         'chances of seeing them in adults. Far from settling the debate, Gage '
         'predicts this provocative paper will intensify interest in this area '
         'of study. “There will be lots and lots more papers,” he says.\n',

         'electrodes implanted at strategic locations. The device has helped '
         'to control tremors in patients with Parkinson’s disease and stop '
         'seizures in those with severe epilepsy. Scientists are now exploring '
         "whether DBS might even help treat Alzheimer's disease. But early "
         'studies of DBS’s effect on memory have been mixed—some tests led to '
         'a boost in performance whereas others resulted in impairment.\n'
         'The different outcomes seem to depend largely on where and when the '
         'stimulation occurs. In the new study, published in Nature '
         'Communications, senior author Michael Kahana wanted to let the '
         "brain’s own activity guide the stimulation. “I've been studying the "
         'electrophysiology of memory processes for many years, and it seemed '
         'to me that [we should] use the electrical signals of the brain that '
         'predict good memory to help teach us how to stimulate the brain,” '
         'says Kahana, who is a professor of psychology at the University of '
         'Pennsylvania.\n'
         'Kahana’s team first had to determine what good memory function '
         'looked like. To do so, the researchers enlisted 25 epilepsy patients '
         'who already had electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor '
         'their seizures. The researchers used the electrodes to measure '
         'neural activity while the patients memorized lists of words. They '
         'then compared brain activity for words the patients recalled '
         'correctly versus words they forgot. Activity in an area of the brain '
         'called the lateral temporal cortex, which is part of the core memory '
         'network, seemed to predict whether or not a patient would later '
         'remember the word.\n'
         'The researchers then developed software that could tell in real time '
         'whether activity in this part of the brain was optimal for '
         'remembering or not. If the software detected the brain was in a poor '
         'learning state, it triggered a small electrical pulse to stimulate '
         'the area. The electrical current in DBS is typically constant, but '
         'this “closed loop” system acts more like a pacemaker, only zapping '
         "the brain when stimulation is needed. “We're inducing neural "
         'activity within the core memory network at a time when the network '
         'has quieted down but it should not have,” Kahana says.\n'
         'Although the study was done in patients without memory impairment, '
         'hope for using DBS to treat dementia is mounting—especially because '
         'the most promising pharmaceutical clinical trials for Alzheimer’s '
         'continue to disappoint. “I think it’s a really exciting finding,” '
         'says Gwenn Smith, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences '
         'at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the work. “The '
         'study was very methodologically elegant and has a lot of potential '
         'for treating memory disorders.”\n'
         'Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the University of '
         'California, Los Angeles, who also did not participate in the study, '
         'agreed the findings were promising but wanted to see more evidence '
         'for clinical impact. “In principle, stimulation which is based on '
         'some neural feedback from the brain offers advantages over ‘standard '
         'DBS,’ which is a one-way street,” he wrote in an e-mail. “However, '
         'it remains to be seen if this method will yield better results.”\n'
         'Andres Lozano, chair of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto '
         'who, with Smith, has conducted several clinical trials using DBS in '
         'Alzheimer’s patients, says the advantages of using intermittent '
         'versus constant stimulation depend on the desired outcome. “The '
         'closed loop is good for things that occur over a short time '
         'frame—seconds. If you’re interested in things that occur over days '
         'or years, then it’s not entirely clear that closed loop is the most '
         'beneficial,” he says.\n'
         'In one trial by Lozano and Smith, Alzheimer’s patients over the age '
         'of 65 who received continuous DBS had less cognitive decline over '
         'the course of a year than patients who did not receive it. DBS also '
         'resulted in higher brain glucose metabolism, which Lozano says is a '
         'sign of improved functioning in neurons. Another study in mice '
         'showed DBS can reduce the presence of amyloid plaques and tau '
         'tangles in the brain—the neurological signatures of Alzheimer’s that '
         'are thought to be behind neurodegeneration. “If the objective is to '
         'slow down the progress of Alzheimer’s, then we may want to stimulate '
         "continuously,” Lozano says. “We're tapping into the brain's "
         'endogenous repair and growth mechanisms, and stimulation can '
         'mobilize those mechanisms.”\n'
         'Other researchers want to take brain implants even further. '
         'Scientists at the University of Southern California and Wake Forest '
         'University are attempting to build a “memory prosthesis” to produce '
         'the electrical signals associated with memories and feed them to the '
         'brain. Using electrodes, computers and complex mathematical models, '
         'they are working to decode the brain activity during learning and '
         'memory so they can re-create the signals if they’re forgotten. So '
         'far, the scientists have succeeded in creating memory-related '
         'signals from learning activity in rats and monkeys, but they have '
         'not yet tested the technology in humans.\n'
         'In the meantime closed-loop stimulation systems are becoming a '
         'reality. The company NeuroPace offers an FDA-approved device to '
         'treat epilepsy. The implants detect activity in the brain that '
         'predicts a seizure and then delivers an electrical pulse to stop the '
         'seizure immediately.\n'
         'Although the research to date has all been framed around improving '
         'memory in patients, the idea of enhancing cognition in those of us '
         'who just need a little boost is not far behind. Bryan Johnson, CEO '
         'of neurotech company Kernel, has said these types of brain '
         'prostheses could one day improve cognition in all of us.\n'
         'Fried, the U.C.L.A. neurosurgeon, dismisses the idea of using '
         'deep-brain stimulation for something as trivial as remembering names '
         'at a cocktail party. “This is invasive technology designed to treat '
         'impairment and alleviate suffering of neurological patients, and is '
         'a medical procedure which should be guided and regulated by '
         'stringent clinical criteria,” he wrote.\n'
         'Kahana was more open to the idea, however. “I think there’s a lot of '
         'concern that invasive technology is too risky to imagine being '
         'deployed at a very\xa0large scale. You could imagine that people '
         'would be reluctant to have brain surgery to get a device that would '
         'improve\xa0their cognitive function,” he says. “But brain surgery '
         'for this kind of technology is becoming safer and safer and safer '
         'every year. [One day] the so-called invasive technologies could '
         'become sufficiently low-risk [so] that we won’t even think about '
         'them as being that invasive anymore.” Cosmetic surgery is ho-hum '
         'routine—and so is LASIK. It still may take some time to get used to '
         'the idea of elective brain surgery. Who wants to go first?\n',

 'text': '“Fake news” is Donald Trump’s favorite catchphrase. Since the '
         'election, it has appeared in some 180 tweets by the President, '
         'decrying everything from accusations of sexual assault against him '
         'to the Russian collusion investigation to reports that he watches up '
         'to eight hours of television a day. Trump may just use “fake news” '

         'there is evidence that real fake news is a serious problem. As one '
         'alarming example, an analysis by the internet media company Buzzfeed '
         'revealed that during the final three months of the 2016 U.S. '
         'presidential campaign, the 20 most popular false election stories '
         'generated around 1.3 million more Facebook engagements—shares, '
         'reactions, and comments—than did the 20 most popular legitimate '
         'stories. The most popular fake story was “Pope Francis Shocks World, '
         'Endorses Donald Trump for President.”\xa0\xa0\n'
         'Fake news can distort people’s beliefs even after being debunked. '
         'For example, repeated over and over, a story such as the one about '
         'the Pope endorsing Trump can create a glow around a political '
         'candidate that persists long after the story is exposed as fake. A '
         'study recently published in the journal Intelligence suggests that '
         'some people may have an especially difficult time rejecting '
         'misinformation. Asked to rate a fictitious person on a range of '
         'character traits, people who scored low on a test of cognitive '
         'ability continued to be influenced by damaging information about the '
         'person even after they were explicitly told the information was '
         'false. The study is significant because it identifies what may be a '
         'major risk factor for vulnerability to fake news.\n'
         'Ghent University researchers Jonas De keersmaecker and Arne Roets '
         'first had over 400 subjects take a personality test. They then '
         'randomly assigned each subject to one of two conditions. In the '
         'experimental condition, the subjects read a biographical description '
         'of a young woman named Nathalie. The bio explained that Nathalie, a '
         'nurse at a local hospital, “was arrested for stealing drugs from the '
         'hospital; she has been stealing drugs for 2 years and selling them '
         'on the street in order to buy designer clothes.” The subjects then '
         'rated Nathalie on traits such as trustworthiness and sincerity, '
         'after which they took a test of cognitive ability. Finally, the '
         'subjects saw a message on their computer screen explicitly stating '
         'that the information about Nathalie stealing drugs and getting '
         'arrested was not true, and then rated her again on the same traits. '
         'The control condition was identical, except that subjects were not '
         'given the paragraph with the false information and rated Nathalie '
         'only once.\n'
         'The subjects in the experimental condition initially rated Nathalie '
         'much more negatively than did the subjects in the control condition. '
         'This was not surprising, considering that they had just learned she '
         'was a thief and a drug dealer. The interesting question was whether '
         'cognitive ability would predict attitude adjustment—that is, the '
         'degree to which the subjects in the experimental condition would '
         'rate Nathalie more favorably after being told that this information '
         'was false. It did: subjects high in cognitive ability adjusted their '
         'ratings more than did those lower in cognitive ability. The subjects '
         'with lower cognitive ability had more trouble shaking their negative '
         'first impression of Nathalie. This was true even after the '
         'researchers statistically controlled for the subjects’ level of '
         'open-mindedness (their willingness to change their mind when wrong) '
         'and right-wing authoritarianism (their intolerance toward others), '
         'as assessed by the personality test. Thus, even if a person was '
         'open-minded and tolerant, a low level of cognitive ability put them '
         'at risk for being unjustifiably harsh in their second evaluation of '
         'Nathalie.\n'
         'One possible explanation for this finding is based on the theory '
         'that a person’s cognitive ability reflects how well they can '
         'regulate the contents of working memory—their “mental workspace” for '
         'processing information. First proposed by the cognitive '
         'psychologists Lynn Hasher and Rose Zacks, this theory holds that '
         'some people are more prone to “mental clutter” than other people. In '
         'other words, some people are less able to discard (or “inhibit”) '
         'information from their working memory that is no longer relevant to '
         'the task at hand—or, as in the case of Nathalie, information that '
         'has been discredited. Research on cognitive aging indicates that, in '
         'adulthood, this ability declines considerably with advancing age, '
         'suggesting that older adults may also be especially vulnerable to '
         'fake news. Another reason why cognitive ability may predict '
         'vulnerability to fake news is that it correlates highly with '
         'education. Through education, people may develop meta-cognitive '
         'skills—strategies for monitoring and regulating one’s own '
         'thinking—that can be used to combat the effects of '
         'misinformation. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n'
         'Meanwhile, other research is shedding light on the mechanisms '
         'underlying the effects of misinformation. Repeating a false claim '
         'increases its believability, giving it an air of what Stephen '
         'Colbert famously called “truthiness.” Known as the illusion of truth '
         'effect, this phenomenon was first demonstrated in the laboratory by '
         'Hasher and her colleagues. On each of three days, subjects listened '
         'to plausible-sounding statements and rated each on whether they '
         'thought it was true. Half of the statements were in fact true, such '
         'as Australia is approximately equal in area to the continental '
         'United States, whereas the other half were false, such as Zachary '
         'Taylor was the first president to die in office (it was William '
         'Henry Harrison). Some of the statements were repeated across days, '
         'whereas others were presented only once. The results showed that the '
         'average truth rating increased from day to day for the repeated '
         'statements, but remained constant for the non-repeated statements, '
         'indicating that subjects mistook familiarity for verity.\n'
         'More recent research reveals that even knowledge of the truth '
         'doesn’t necessarily protect against the illusion of truth. In a 2015 '
         'study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, '
         'Lisa Fazio and her colleagues asked subjects to rate a set of '
         'statements on how interesting they found them. Following Hasher and '
         'colleagues’ procedure, some of the statements were true, whereas '
         'others were false. The subjects then rated a second set of '
         'statements for truthfulness on a six-point scale, from definitely '
         'false to definitely true. Some of the statements were repeated from '
         'the first set, whereas others were new. Finally, the subjects took a '
         'knowledge test that included questions based on the statements. The '
         'results revealed that repetition increased the subjects’ perception '
         'of the truthfulness of false statements, even for statements they '
         'knew to be false. For example, even if a subject correctly answered '
         'Pacific Ocean to the question What is the largest ocean on Earth? on '
         'the knowledge test, they still tended to give the false statement '
         'The Atlantic Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth a higher truth '
         'rating if it was repeated. When a claim was made to feel familiar '
         'through repetition, subjects neglected to consult their own '
         'knowledge base in rating the claim’s truthfulness.\n'
         'These studies add to scientific understanding of the fake news '
         'problem, which is providing a foundation for an evidenced-based '
         'approach to addressing the problem. A recommendation that follows '
         'from research on the illusion of truth effect is to serve as your '
         'own fact checker. If you are convinced that some claim is true, ask '
         'yourself why. Is it because you have credible evidence that the '
         'claim is true, or is it just because you’ve encountered the claim '
         'over and over? Also ask yourself if you know of any evidence that '
         'refutes the claim. (You just might be surprised to find that you '
         'do.) This type of recommendation could be promoted through public '
         'service announcements, which have been shown to be effective for '
         'things like getting people to litter less and recycle more. For its '
         'part, research on individual differences in susceptibility to fake '
         'news, such as the study by De keersmaecker and Roets, can help to '
         'identify people who are particularly important to reach through this '
         'type of informational campaign.\n'
         'At a more general level, this research underscores the threat that '
         'fake news poses to democratic society. The aim of using fake news as '
         'propaganda is to make people think and behave in ways they wouldn’t '
         'otherwise—for example, hold a view that is contradicted by '
         'overwhelming scientific consensus. When this nefarious aim is '
         'achieved, citizens no longer have the ability to act in their own '
         'self-interest. In the logic of democracy, this isn’t just bad for '
         'that citizen—it’s bad for society.\n',

         'suggested such scans—which use high-frequency sound waves to create '
         'an image of the fetus, placenta and surrounding maternal organs—are '
         'not a powerful enough environmental risk to cause autism on their '
         'own.\n'
         'But the new study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, did leave '
         'one question unanswered: Does the depth of the actual ultrasound '
         'scan make a difference? The work found the children with autism were '
         'exposed to prenatal ultrasounds with greater penetration than the '
         'control group: During the first trimester, the group with autism had '
         'scans with an average depth of 12.5 centimeters compared with 11.6 '
         'centimeters for the control group. And during the second trimester '
         'the group with autism had scan depths of 12.9 centimeters compared '
         'with 12.5 centimeters for the typical development control group. '
         'Ultrasounds may not be uniform for reasons including the position of '
         'the fetus in the womb.\n'
         'Perhaps, the authors wrote, greater ultrasound depth could result in '
         'more harmful exposure to energy emissions—potentially causing damage '
         'to the developing fetuses’ cells and brains. Yet the authors '
         'themselves cautioned there is not enough evidence in humans to draw '
         'that conclusion and that further, larger studies should be launched '
         'to explore that relationship. Moreover, they noted, a variety of '
         'elements including the mother’s body mass index, gestational '
         'diabetes and aspects of ultrasonographic exposure—including '
         'depth—might be intertwined.\n'
         'Sara Jane Webb, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral '
         'sciences at the University of Washington, wrote in an accompanying '
         'editorial in JAMA Pediatrics that she is not convinced the deeper '
         'ultrasound wave penetration is a concern. On balance, she told '
         'Scientific American, the increased depth would likely not be '
         'significant enough to outweigh the fact that the group with autism '
         'had less ultrasound exposure time. “We think there are probably '
         'fetuses vulnerable to autism due to genetic errors and environmental '
         'factors,” she says. “But this study does not provide any additional '
         'support for ultrasound being a single cause.”\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Talking with—Not Just to—Kids Powers How They Learn Language',
 'text': 'Children from the poorer strata of society begin life not only with '
         'material disadvantages but cognitive ones. Decades of research have '
         'confirmed this, including a famous 1995 finding by psychologists '
         'Betty Hart and Todd Risley: By age four children reared in poverty '
         'have heard 30 million fewer words, on average, than their peers from '
         'wealthier families. That gap has been linked to shakier language '
         'skills at the start of school, which, in turn, predicts weaker '
         'academic performance.\n'
         'But the sheer quantity of words a toddler hears is not the most '
         'significant influence on language acquisition. Growing evidence has '
         'led researchers to conclude quality matters more than quantity, and '
         'the most valuable quality seems to be back-and-forth '
         'communication—what researchers variously call conversational turns, '
         'duets or contingent talk.\n'
         'A paper published last week in Psychological Science brings a new '
         'dimension of support to this idea, offering the first evidence these '
         'exchanges play a vital role in the development of Broca’s area, the '
         'brain region most closely associated with producing speech. Further, '
         'the amount of conversational turns a child experiences daily '
         'outweighs socioeconomic status in predicting both activity in '
         'Broca’s area and the child’s language skills.\n'
         'The study, from the lab of neuroscientist John Gabrieli of '
         'Massachusetts Institute of Technology, involved 36 children, ages '
         'four to six, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It had three '
         'components: First, researchers used standardized tests to evaluate '
         'each child’s verbal ability and derive a composite score. Second, '
         'the brain of each child was scanned using functional magnetic '
         'resonance imaging (fMRI) while the child listened to very short '
         '(15-second) stories. Lastly, adult–child communication at home was '
         'evaluated for two days using a state-of-the art recording and '
         'analysis system called LENA (Language Environment Analysis) to '
         'measure adult speech, the child’s utterances and their '
         '“conversational turns”—paired exchanges separated by no more than '
         'five seconds.\n'
         'The researchers confirmed the classic 1995 finding that, overall, '
         'kids from wealthier families hear more words. And although their '
         'sample was small, they even confirmed the 30-million-word gap '
         'between the poorest and richest children. But what correlated most '
         'closely with a child’s verbal score was not the number of words he '
         'or she heard but the number of conversational turns. And these '
         'exchanges were the only aspect of language measured by LENA that '
         'correlated with the intensity of activity seen in Broca’s area '
         'during the fMRI story session. “We found that by far the biggest '
         'driver for brain development was not the number of words spoken but '
         'the conversations,” Gabrieli says. And although on average parents '
         'with greater income and education have more of these verbal '
         'exchanges with their young children, “there’s pretty good '
         'diversity,” he notes. In other words, some low-income parents '
         'engaged in a lot of conversation with their child and some wealthier '
         'parents conversed relatively little.\n'
         'The researchers calculated that a child’s verbal ability score '
         'increased by one point for every additional 11 conversational '
         'exchanges per hour.\n'
         'How exactly exposure to these exchanges alters Broca’s area is a '
         'question Gabrieli’s team is exploring in subsequent research. “We '
         'know that greater activation in Broca’s area was associated with '
         'better verbal abilities overall, so it seems like greater activation '
         'is good,” he says. One possibility is back-and-forth communication '
         'promotes more connections between brain cells in that region.\n'
         'The study is a “very, very important” addition to a growing body of '
         'work, says developmental psychologist Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek, director '
         'of the Infant Language Laboratory at Temple University, who was not '
         'involved in the work. “We have known for quite a while that '
         'conversational turns—or what in my work we call conversational '
         'duets—are very important for building a foundation for language and '
         'maybe for learning generally. What hadn’t been done is to link it '
         'where we knew it had to be linked—to changes in the brain.”\n'
         'Verbal exchanges have two components that children must master: '
         'temporal contingency and semantic contingency—essentially, '
         'understanding the timing of human conversation and how to respond '
         'meaningfully. Research, including Hirsh-Pasek’s, has shown children '
         'cannot learn this from watching television, although they can learn '
         'it via video-chat technology such as Apple’s FaceTime.\n'
         'Contingent language begins in infancy—well before words emerge—when '
         'parents begin “cooing” and “gooing” at their babies, who respond in '
         'kind. Socioeconomic differences in this behavior arise during the '
         'first year of life, according to a 2017 study of 141 11-month-olds '
         'by Michelle McGillion of The University of Sheffield in England and '
         'colleagues.\n'
         'Research in this area has big implications for parents and '
         'caregivers. The search is on for interventions that will increase '
         'adult–child conversation and boost early language skills, especially '
         'for families living in poverty. McGillion’s study, for instance, '
         'showed language learning took off for babies in low-income settings '
         'when caregivers were given instructions to spend 15 minutes a day '
         'engaging their infant by commenting on whatever the baby looked at. '
         'Unfortunately, the improvements did not persist at age two with this '
         'low-intensity intervention.\n'
         'Encouraging conversation seems particularly necessary in an era when '
         'both children and adults are spending more time with devices and '
         'less in face-to-face communication. “The exchanges are not only '
         'about words but about feelings, about paying attention to someone '
         'else,” Gabrieli observes. Hearing language from television or Alexa, '
         'he says, “does very little compared to these exchanges.”\n'
         'Hirsh-Pasek shares this concern about technology. One 2017 study she '
         'co-authored found that when a cell phone call interrupts an '
         'interaction in which a parent is teaching a child a new word, the '
         'learning is lost. \n'
         'While we are fiddling with our digital devices, “evolution is '
         'screaming at us,” she says. “It’s saying, ‘Hey, in case you didn’t '
         'notice, there’s another human in the room—pay attention.’ If we '
         'learn better how to follow the eyes of our child and comment on what '
         'they are looking at, we will have strong language learners. And '
         'language is the single-best predictor of school readiness—in math, '
         'social skills and reading skills. It is the foundation for '
         'learning.”\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'An AI That Knows the World Like Children Do',
 'text': 'If you spend much time with children, you’re bound to wonder how '
         'young human beings can possibly learn so much so quickly. '
         'Philosophers, going all the way back to Plato, have wondered, too, '
         'but they’ve never found a satisfying answer. My five-year-old '
         'grandson, Augie, has learned about plants, animals and clocks, not '
         'to mention dinosaurs and spaceships. He also can figure out what '
         'other people want and how they think and feel. He can use that '
         'knowledge to classify what he sees and hears and make new '
         'predictions. He recently proclaimed, for example, that the newly '
         'discovered species of titanosaur on display at the American Museum '
         'of Natural History in New York City is a plant eater, so that means '
         'it really isn’t that scary.\n'
         'Yet all that reaches Augie from his environment is a stream of '
         'photons hitting his retina and disturbances of air contacting his '
         'eardrums. The neural computer that sits behind his blue eyes manages '
         'somehow to start with that limited information from his senses and '
         'to end up making predictions about plant-eating titanosaurs. One '
         'lingering question is whether electronic computers can do the same.\n'
         'During the past 15 years or so computer scientists and psychologists '
         'have been trying to find an answer. Children acquire a great deal of '
         'knowledge with little input from teachers or parents. Despite '
         'enormous strides in machine intelligence, even the most powerful '
         'computers still cannot learn as well as a five-year-old does.\n'
         'Figuring out how the child brain actually functions—and then '
         'creating a digital version that will work as effectively—will '
         'challenge computer scientists for decades to come. But in the '
         'meantime, they are beginning to develop artificial intelligence that '
         'incorporates some of what we know about how humans learn.\n'
         'After the first burst of enthusiasm in the 1950s and 1960s, the '
         'quest for AI languished for decades. In the past few years, though, '
         'there have been striking advances, especially in the field of '
         'machine learning, and AI has become one of the hottest developments '
         'in technology. Many utopian or apocalyptic predictions have emerged '
         'about what those advances mean. They have, quite literally, been '
         'taken to presage either immortality or the end of the world, and a '
         'lot has been written about both these possibilities.\n'
         'I suspect that developments in AI lead to such strong feelings '
         'because of our deep-seated fear of the almost human. The idea that '
         'creatures might bridge the gap between the human and the artificial '
         'has always been deeply disturbing, from the medieval golem to '
         'Frankenstein’s monster to Ava, the sexy robot fatale in the 2015 '
         'movie Ex Machina.\n'
         'But do computers really learn as well as humans? How much of the '
         'heated rhetoric points to revolutionary change, and how much is just '
         'hype? The details of how computers learn to recognize, say, a cat, a '
         'spoken word or a Japanese character can be hard to follow. But on '
         'closer inspection, the basic ideas behind machine learning are not '
         'as baffling as they first seem.\n'
         'One approach tries to solve the problem by starting with the stream '
         'of photons and air vibrations that Augie, and all of us, '
         'receives—and that reaches the computer as pixels of a digital image '
         'and sound samples of an audio recording. It then tries to extract a '
         'series of patterns in the digital data that can detect and identify '
         'whole objects in the surrounding world. This so-called bottom-up '
         'approach has roots in the ideas of philosophers such as David Hume '
         'and John Stuart Mill and psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov and B. F. '
         'Skinner, among others.\n'
         'In the 1980s scientists figured out a compelling and ingenious way '
         'to apply bottom-up methods to let computers hunt for meaningful '
         'patterns in data. “Connectionist,” or “neural network,” systems take '
         'inspiration from the way that neurons convert light patterns at your '
         'retina into representations of the world around you. A neural '
         'network does something similar. It uses interconnected processing '
         'elements, akin to biological cells, to transform pixels at one layer '
         'of the network into increasingly abstract representations—a nose or '
         'an entire face—as data are crunched at progressively higher layers.\n'
         'Neural-network ideas have gone through a recent revival because of '
         'new techniques called deep learning—technology now being '
         'commercialized by Google, Facebook and other tech giants. The ever '
         'increasing power of computers—the exponential increase in computing '
         'capability that is captured by what is known as Moore’s law—also has '
         'a part in the new success of these systems. So does the development '
         'of enormously large data sets. With better processing capabilities '
         'and more data to crunch, connectionist systems can learn far more '
         'effectively than we might have once thought.\n'
         'Over the years the AI community has seesawed between favoring these '
         'kinds of bottom-up solutions to machine learning and alternative '
         'top-down approaches. Top-down approaches leverage what a system '
         'already knows to help it learn something new. Plato, as well as '
         'so-called rationalist philosophers such as René Descartes, believed '
         'in a top-down approach to learning—and it played a big role in early '
         'AI. In the 2000s such methods also experienced their own rebirth in '
         'the form of probabilistic, or Bayesian, modeling.\n'
         'Like scientists, top-down systems start out by formulating abstract '
         'and wide-ranging hypotheses about the world. The systems then make '
         'predictions about what the data should look like if those hypotheses '
         'are correct. Also like scientists, the systems then revise their '
         'hypotheses, depending on the outcome of those predictions.\n'
         'Bottom-up methods are perhaps the most readily understood, so let’s '
         'consider them first. Imagine that you are trying to get your '
         'computer to separate important messages from the spam that arrives '
         'in your in-box. You might notice that spam tends to have certain '
         'distinguishing characteristics: a long list of recipient addressees, '
         'an originating address in Nigeria or Bulgaria, references to '
         '$1-million prizes or perhaps mention of Viagra. But perfectly useful '
         'messages might look the same. You don’t want to miss the '
         'announcement that you have earned a promotion or an academic award.\n'
         'If you compare enough examples of spam against other types of '
         'e-mails, you might notice that only the spam tends to have qualities '
         'that combine in certain telltale ways—Nigeria, for instance, plus a '
         'promise of a $1-million prize together spell trouble. In fact, there '
         'might be some quite subtle higher-level patterns that discriminate '
         'between the spam messages and the useful ones—misspellings and IP '
         'addresses that are not at all obvious, for example. If you could '
         'detect them, you could accurately filter out the spam—without fear '
         'of missing a notice that your Viagra has shipped.\n'
         'Bottom-up machine learning can ferret out the relevant clues to '
         'solve this kind of task. To do this, a neural network must go '
         'through its own learning process. It evaluates millions of examples '
         'from huge databases, each labeled as spam or as an authentic e-mail. '
         'The computer then extracts a set of identifying features that '
         'separate spam from everything else.\n'
         'In a similar way, the network might inspect Internet images labeled '
         '“cat,” “house,” “stegosaurus,” and so on. By extracting the common '
         'features in each set of images—the pattern that distinguishes all '
         'the cats from all the dogs—it can identify new images of a cat, even '
         'if it has never seen those particular images before.\n'
         'One bottom-up method, called unsupervised learning, is still in its '
         'relative infancy, but it can detect patterns in data that have no '
         'labels at all. It simply looks for clusters of features that '
         'identify an object—noses and eyes, for example, always go together '
         'to form a face and differ from the trees and mountains in the '
         'background. Identifying an object in these advanced deep-learning '
         'networks takes place through a division of labor in which '
         'recognition tasks are apportioned among different layers of the '
         'network.\n'
         'An article in 2015 in Nature demonstrated just how far bottom-up '
         'methods have come. Researchers at DeepMind, a company owned by '
         'Google, used a combination of two different bottom-up '
         'techniques—deep learning and reinforcement learning—in a way that '
         'enabled a computer to master Atari 2600 video games. The computer '
         'began knowing nothing about how the games worked. At first, it made '
         'random guesses about the best moves while receiving constant '
         'feedback about its performance. Deep learning helped the system '
         'identify the features on the screen, and reinforcement learning '
         'rewarded it for a high score. The computer achieved a high '
         'proficiency level with several games; in some cases, it performed '
         'better than expert human players. That said, it also completely '
         'bombed on other games that are just as easy for humans to master.\n'
         'The ability to apply AI to learn from large data sets—millions of '
         'Instagram images, e-mail messages or voice recordings—allows '
         'solutions to problems that once seemed daunting, such as image and '
         'speech recognition. Even so, it is worth remembering that my '
         'grandson has no trouble at all recognizing an animal or responding '
         'to a spoken query even with much more limited data and training. '
         'Problems that are easy for a human five-year-old are still extremely '
         'perplexing to computers and much harder than learning to play '
         'chess.\n'
         'Computers that learn to recognize a whiskered, furry face often need '
         'millions of examples to categorize objects that we can classify with '
         'just a few. After extensive training, the computer might be able to '
         'identify an image of a cat that it has never seen before. But it '
         'does so in ways that are quite different from human generalizations. '
         'Because the computer software reasons differently, slipups occur. '
         'Some cat images will not be labeled as cats. And the computer may '
         'incorrectly say an image is a cat, although it is actually just a '
         'random blur, one that would never fool a human observer.\n'
         'The other approach to machine learning that has transformed AI in '
         'recent years works in the opposite direction, from the top down. It '
         'assumes that we can get abstract knowledge from concrete data '
         'because we already know a lot and especially because the brain is '
         'already capable of understanding basic abstract concepts. Like '
         'scientists, we can use those concepts to formulate hypotheses about '
         'the world and make predictions about what data (events) should look '
         'like if those hypotheses are right—the reverse of trying to extract '
         'patterns from the raw data themselves, as in bottom-up AI.\n'
         'This idea can best be illustrated by revisiting the spam plague '
         'through considering a real case in which I was involved. I received '
         'an e-mail from the editor of a journal with a strange name, '
         'referring specifically to one of my papers and proposing that I '
         'write an article for the publication. No Nigeria, no Viagra, no '
         'million dollars—the e-mail had none of the common indications of a '
         'spam message. But by using what I already knew and thinking in an '
         'abstract way about the process that produces spam, I could figure '
         'out that this e-mail was suspicious.\n'
         'To start, I knew that spammers try to extract money from people by '
         'appealing to human greed—and academics can be as greedy to publish '
         'as ordinary folks are for $1-million prizes or better sexual '
         'performance. I also knew that legitimate “open access” journals have '
         'started covering their costs by charging authors instead of '
         'subscribers. Also, my work has nothing to do with the journal title. '
         'Putting all that together, I produced a plausible hypothesis that '
         'the e-mail was trying to sucker academics into paying to “publish” '
         'an article in a fake journal. I could draw this conclusion from just '
         'one example, and I could go on to test my hypothesis further by '
         'checking the editor’s bona fides through a search-engine query.\n'
         'A computer scientist would call my reasoning process a “generative '
         'model,” one that is able to represent abstract concepts, such as '
         'greed and deception. This same model can also describe the process '
         'that is used to come up with a hypothesis—the reasoning that led to '
         'the conclusion that the message might be an e-mail scam. The model '
         'lets me explain how this form of spam works, but it also lets me '
         'imagine other kinds of spam or even a type that differs from any I '
         'have seen or heard about before. When I receive the e-mail from the '
         'journal, the model lets me work backward—tracing step by step why it '
         'must be spam.\n'
         'Generative models were essential in the first wave of AI and '
         'cognitive science in the 1950s and 1960s. But they also had '
         'limitations. First, most patterns of evidence might, in principle, '
         'be explained by many different hypotheses. In my case, it could be '
         'that the e-mail really was legitimate, even though it seemed '
         'unlikely. Thus, generative models have to incorporate ideas about '
         'probability, one of the most important recent developments for these '
         'methods. Second, it is often unclear where the basic concepts that '
         'make up generative models come from. Thinkers such as Descartes and '
         'Noam Chomsky suggested that you are born with them firmly in place, '
         'but do you really come into this world knowing how greed and '
         'deception lead to cons?\n'
         'Bayesian models—a prime example of a recent top-down method—attempt '
         'to deal with both issues. Named after 18th-century statistician and '
         'philosopher Thomas Bayes, they combine generative models with '
         'probability theory using a technique called Bayesian inference. A '
         'probabilistic generative model can tell you how likely it is that '
         'you will see a specific pattern of data if a particular hypothesis '
         'is true. If the e-mail is a scam, it probably appeals to the greed '
         'of the reader. But of course, a message could appeal to greed '
         'without being spam. A Bayesian model combines the knowledge you '
         'already have about potential hypotheses with the data you see to let '
         'you calculate, quite precisely, just how likely it is that an e-mail '
         'is legitimate or spam.\n'
         'This top-down method fits better than its bottom-up counterpart with '
         'what we know about how children learn. That is why, for the past 15 '
         'years, my colleagues and I have used Bayesian models in our work on '
         'child development. Our laboratory and others have used these '
         'techniques to understand how children learn about cause-and-effect '
         'relationships, predicting how and when youngsters will develop new '
         'beliefs about the world and when they will change the beliefs they '
         'already have.\n'
         'Bayesian methods are also an excellent way to teach machines to '
         'learn like people. In 2015 Joshua B. Tenenbaum of the Massachusetts '
         'Institute of Technology, with whom I sometimes collaborate, Brenden '
         'M. Lake of New York University and their colleagues published a '
         'study in Science. They designed an AI system that could recognize '
         'unfamiliar handwritten characters, a job that is simple for people '
         'but extremely taxing for computers.\n'
         'Think of your own recognition skills. Even if you have never seen a '
         'character in a Japanese scroll, you can probably tell if it is the '
         'same or different from one on another scroll. You can probably draw '
         'it and even design a fake Japanese character—and understand as well '
         'that it looks quite different from a Korean or Russian character. '
         'That is just what Tenenbaum’s team members got their software to '
         'do.\n'
         'With a bottom-up method, the computer would be presented with '
         'thousands of examples and would use the patterns found in those '
         'examples to identify new characters. Instead the Bayesian program '
         'gave the machine a general model of how to draw a character: for '
         'example, a stroke can go right or left. And after the software '
         'finishes one character, it goes on to the next.\n'
         'When the program saw a given character, it could infer the sequence '
         'of strokes that were needed to draw it, and it went on to produce a '
         'similar set of strokes on its own. It did so the same way that I '
         'inferred the series of steps that led to my dubious spam e-mail from '
         'the journal. Instead of weighing whether a marketing scam was likely '
         'to lead to that e-mail, Tenenbaum’s model guessed whether a '
         'particular stroke sequence was likely to produce the desired '
         'character. This top-down program worked much better than deep '
         'learning applied to exactly the same data, and it closely mirrored '
         'the performance of human beings.\n'
         'These two leading approaches to machine learning—bottom up and top '
         'down—have complementary strengths and weaknesses. With a bottom-up '
         'method, the computer does not need to understand anything about cats '
         'to begin with, but it does need a great deal of data.\n'
         'The Bayesian system can learn from just a few examples, and it can '
         'generalize more widely. This top-down approach, though, requires a '
         'lot of work up front to articulate the right set of hypotheses. And '
         'designers of both types of systems can run into similar hurdles. The '
         'two approaches work only on relatively narrow and well-defined '
         'problems, such as recognizing written characters or cats or playing '
         'Atari games.\n'
         'Children do not labor under the same constraints. Developmental '
         'psychologists have found that young children somehow combine the '
         'best qualities of each approach—and then take them much further. '
         'Augie can learn from just one or two examples, the way a top-down '
         'system does. But he also somehow extracts new concepts from the data '
         'themselves, like a bottom-up system. These concepts were not there '
         'to begin with.\n'
         'Augie can actually do much more. He immediately recognizes cats and '
         'tells letters apart, but he can also make creative and surprising '
         'new inferences that go far beyond his experience or background '
         'knowledge. He recently explained that if an adult wants to become a '
         'child again he or she should try not eating any healthy vegetables, '
         'because they make a child grow into an adult. We have almost no idea '
         'how this kind of creative reasoning emerges.\n'
         'We should recall the still mysterious powers of the human mind when '
         'we hear claims that AI is an existential threat. Artificial '
         'intelligence and machine learning sound scary. And in some ways, '
         'they are. The military is researching ways to use these systems to '
         'control weapons. Natural stupidity can wreak far more havoc than '
         'artificial intelligence, and we humans will need to be much smarter '
         'than we have been in the past to properly regulate the new '
         'technologies. Moore’s law is an influential force: even if advances '
         'in computing result from quantitative increases in data and computer '
         'power, rather than conceptual revolutions in our understanding of '
         'the mind, they can still have momentous, practical consequences. '
         'That said, we shouldn’t think that a new technological golem is '
         'about to be unleashed on the world.\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Trump’s Perfect Score on Brain Test Spawns DIY Cognitive Exam',
 'text': 'When Donald Trump aced a cognitive test in January, scores of people '
         'tried to take it, too, based mostly on\xa0media reports\xa0that '
         'invited them to match wits with the president.\n'
         'Casual users puzzled over\xa0line drawings of animals, while others '
         'wondered what it meant if they were bad at subtracting by sevens.\n'
         'That was a mistake, according to the scientist who created the\xa0'
         'Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MoCA, a popular screening tool '
         'designed to spotlight potential problems with thinking and memory. '
         'The MoCA was never meant for general use and it requires a health '
         'professional to monitor the test and interpret the results.\n'
         'Media coverage challenged people “to test yourself to see if you '
         'fare as well as Mr. Trump, but that wouldn’t give them the accurate '
         'response,” said Dr. Ziad Nasreddine, the Lebanese-Canadian '
         'neurologist who holds the copyright to the MoCA. “You need a trained '
         'person to administer this test.”\n'
         'But with interest in the test so high, Nasreddine and his colleagues '
         'saw an opportunity. Weeks after Trump posted his perfect MoCA score '
         '(30/30), the researchers started working on a new tool, dubbed the '
         '“mini-MoCA,” an online, self-administered exam for people worried '
         'about possible cognitive decline.\n'
         '“We thought, ‘OK, why shouldn’t we take the lead and develop the '
         'test?’” said Nasreddine, who had been pondering such a move for '
         'several years. “It’s good timing to offer something for families and '
         'concerned individuals that they can self-test themselves.”\n'
         'Such a test could potentially expand detection of mild cognitive '
         'impairment, or MCI, the earliest stage of dementia. Up to 1 in 5 '
         'people age 65 and older have MCI, and more\xa0than half progress to '
         'dementia within five years.\n'
         'Learning about problems early allows affected people to arrange '
         'their finances, seek out clinical trials and otherwise make plans '
         'for future care, said Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and '
         'scientific operations for the Alzheimer’s Association.\n'
         '“I’d do big picture and talk about why early detection is so '
         'important,” she said.\n'
         'But several screening tests—more than a dozen—are available. None of '
         'them provides a definitive diagnosis and, like them, any new '
         'web-based self-assessment, including the mini-MoCA, could have its '
         'limitations, experts suggest.\n'
         '“Is it a good idea? I think there’s some value for people to get '
         'some sense of how they’re doing,” said Dr. James Galvin, founding '
         'director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at Florida '
         'Atlantic University. “But whatever result comes out of a test, they '
         'still need to discuss it with a health professional to put it in '
         'perspective.”\n'
         'Much of the mini-MoCA’s success will depend on how the new tool is '
         'designed. It must be sensitive enough to highlight potential '
         'problems, but not so broad that it generates high numbers of '
         'false-positive results, said Dr. Dean Foti, a clinical assistant '
         'professor of neurology at the University of British Columbia.\n'
         '“You have to really consider being overly sensitive and causing '
         'unnecessary anxiety in people,” he said.\n'
         'Nasreddine said his team is working now to validate the mini-MoCA, '
         'which will be a scaled-down version of the original tool. The MoCA '
         'was developed more than 20 years ago to help detect MCI. It has been '
         'translated into several versions and multiple languages and is used '
         'in all of the National Institute on Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease '
         'Centers.\n'
         'The original MoCA is a 10-minute, 30-question exam. Instead, the '
         'mini-MoCA will be a five-minute, six-question test, Nasreddine '
         'indicated. Like the original test, it will include exercises focused '
         'on naming objects and animals, verbal fluency, calculation, clock '
         'time, abstraction and memory.\n'
         'And, like the original, if people score fewer than 26 of 30 possible '
         'points, they’d be urged to consult a doctor for further screening.\n'
         'Nasreddine is testing the first version of the mini-MoCA in 50 '
         'patients at the\xa0Neuro Rive-Sud memory clinic, comparing their '
         'scores on the new test with those from the original exam, long '
         'regarded as a valid screening tool for MCI.\n'
         'If the results are good, he’ll move to a second stage with more '
         'patients and stricter criteria.\n'
         'All told, the process could take up to eight months. Nasreddine is '
         'considering charging $1 or $2 per test to fund future research. Many '
         'tests that screen for dementia are free.\n'
         '“We have to make sure that the precision and the purpose of the test '
         'are well-explained to the public with the limitations for '
         'interpreting the results,” Nasreddine said. “I think it will be a '
         'useful tool for the public to help guide and inform them about their '
         'cognition.”\n'

         'Health Conditions',
 'text': 'BOSTON—Evan Jones was excited when he signed up for a contemporary '
         'art class at community college. Then the professor announced the '
         'course would focus heavily on class participation.\n'
         '“That was the first class that I dropped,” he said.\n'
         'Jones’s persistent, severe anxiety has shadowed him for years. He’s '
         'struggled to pipe up in class and to make friends. His anxiety was '
         'so acute, he left high school; after getting his GED, he has bounced '
         'around, taking classes at three colleges over the past five years. '
         'He blamed himself every time he dropped a class.\n'
         '“I’ve never really found the right place for me,” he said.\n'
         'Then he found a program that promised to do what every other school '
         'had failed at: support him as a whole person, not just try to push '
         'him through credit after credit.\n'
         'For the past three years, Boston University has offered one of the '
         'few programs in the nation dedicated to teaching students who have '
         'had to leave college the coping skills that will give them a shot at '
         'getting back into school or work while managing severe anxiety, '
         'depression, and other serious mental health conditions.\n'
         'For Jones, 24, who has a sharp mind for technology and a striking '
         'openness about his struggles, it was much-needed shot at figuring '
         'out a future for himself.\n'
         '“We were running out of options for him. This is exactly what he '
         'needed,” his dad, Jeremy Jones, said.\n'
         'The semester-long program takes its name from the Latin word niteo: '
         'to thrive.\n'
         'Ten students shuffled in on the first day of classes this September '
         'and found a seat around a conference table. They played one of those '
         'classic getting-to-know-you games: say your name, your go-to karaoke '
         'song, and the last college you attended.\n'
         'That last question spoke to why they were all here. They’d been '
         'enrolled in colleges and universities across the country. And then '
         'they weren’t. Some opted for medical leave or were asked by their '
         'universities to take time off after a mental health crisis. Others '
         'dropped out.\n'
         'Taking time off from college for mental health problems is a loss. '
         'It’s a loss of independence, of routine, of friends, of a place, a '
         'purpose, and a clear-cut goal.\n'
         'NITEO fills that gap. It gives the students a peer group and a place '
         'to go three days a week. It gives them assignments, accountability, '
         'and a personal coach to cheer them on. It gives them a path '
         'forward.\n'
         'It also gives students an explanation for their absence from campus. '
         'It’s not easy to tell friends they’re home for the semester due to a '
         'mental health issue. Instead, they can say, “I’m taking classes at '
         'Boston University this semester.” And it’s true.\n'
         '“They’re learning to manage a significant health condition and go to '
         'college at the same time,” said Courtney Joly-Lowdermilk, who runs '
         'the NITEO program and has worked for more than a decade in mental '
         'health and disability services in higher education.\n'
         'Joly-Lowdermilk is brimming with energy when other people are still '
         'rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. One student called her “a giant '
         'ball of enthusiasm who cares about everybody.” She keeps an '
         'impressive mental Rolodex of every student’s assignments, anxieties, '
         'even their weekend plans. She runs the program along with a crew of '
         'compassionate coaches and teachers who bend over backwards to meet a '
         'student’s needs, whether that’s something as simple as sending them '
         'a wake-up text or as deeply personal as crafting a letter '
         'recommending that they be reinstated at school.\n'
         'NITEO also leans on peer mentor interns, who’ve completed the '
         'program and come back to give the kind of guidance only another '
         'young person can offer.\n'
         'The program isn’t right for every student, and even those who '
         'graduate continue to grapple with challenges at school and work. But '
         'the early data on alumni are promising and other colleges are now '
         'looking to replicate the program, which charges students $8,500 for '
         'the semester. Grants from the Sidney R. Baer Jr. Foundation—Baer '
         'himself had schizophrenia—covered tuition for the first four cohorts '
         'of students. Now, donations from the families of former NITEO '
         'students help cover some of the costs for those who can’t pay.\n'
         'The need is substantial: More than one-third of incoming college '
         'students reported feeling anxious frequently in a survey conducted '
         'last year by the University of California, Los Angeles. Another 12 '
         'percent said they’d often been depressed in the past year. Many of '
         'those students turn to the free or low-cost counseling services on '
         'their campuses for help. But colleges have struggled to keep up in '
         'recent years as demand has spiked.\n'
         '“There’s no question. The need for mental health services is '
         'increasing dramatically across the board,” said Ben Locke, the '
         'director of counseling and psychological services at Penn State '
         'University.\n'
         'That’s put a strain on many college counseling centers.\xa0A STAT '
         'investigation\xa0earlier this year found that students on many '
         'campuses were stranded on weeks-long waitlists for basic counseling '
         'services. And many schools offered only a limited amount of care—on '
         'some campuses, just two free appointments a year.\n'
         'Some students end up taking medical leave, if it’s offered. But the '
         'time off school—and the transition back—can be incredibly tough. To '
         'return to college, students often have to fill out applications, '
         'meet with a counselor, and make the case that they’re ready to come '
         'back.\n'
         'The NITEO program is a test run.\n'
         '“We assign a paper and they feel their anxiety ratcheting up,” said '
         'Dori Hutchinson, director of services at the BU Center for '
         'Psychiatric Rehabilitation, which houses the NITEO program. “We need '
         'to provide a lab for them here to practice those skills.”\n'
         'Though most don’t count as college credits, every class is an '
         'opportunity help students confront their anxieties. An improv '
         'session is a chance to practice public presentations and prepare the '
         'students for that sickening feeling of being put on the spot by a '
         'professor. A lecture about resilience is a chance to practice '
         'note-taking.\n'
         'There’s also a strong emphasis on social connection. Every Friday, '
         'the students hang out after class. They’ve gone to the Museum of '
         'Fine Arts and Boston Common, carved pumpkins and ice skated. They '
         'crushed their coaches in a students vs. staff basketball game, 36 to '
         '24.\n'
         'This semester’s participants hail from mainly from Massachusetts, '
         'though there are students who came from colleges out of state, too. '
         'Their interests range from video game design and dance to speech '
         'pathology and foreign language. Their mental health challenges range '
         'from anxiety and attention disorders to depression and bipolar '
         'disorder.\n'
         'They’re a remarkable peer group—despite their differences, they each '
         'know, in a visceral way, what the others are going through. That’s a '
         'comfort to students who’ve been singled out at their own schools '
         'because of their mental health challenges.\n'
         '“Everyone’s working on things and everyone’s trying their best to '
         'get past those issues,” Jones said. “I don’t feel like I’m the '
         'broken one.”\n'
         'A cornerstone of the program is personal coaching. Every student '
         'gets paired with a staffer who walks them through even minor tasks '
         'that can feel overwhelming, from filling out transfer applications '
         'to managing homework.\n'
         'It isn’t your typical once-a-week counseling session. Coaches set up '
         'early morning coffee dates with students dealing with depression who '
         'have a hard time getting out of bed. They come up with healthier '
         'meal plans. They FaceTime about assignments with looming deadlines. '
         'They send wake-up texts.\n'
         'Every Tuesday, Jones and his coach, Paul Cherchia, went on a run.\n'
         'At the start of the program, Jones had set goals including getting '
         'his own physical wellness back on track and finding ways to be '
         'productive on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the program doesn’t meet. '
         'So he and Cherchia—who got a graduate degree in psychology while '
         'working in admissions at BU—set up a plan to go running on Tuesdays '
         'during lunch. They wound through the back streets of Brookline, a '
         'neighborhood peppered with beautiful homes set back from the road, '
         'talking about what comes next for Jones.\n'
         'One day, they jogged around the Charles River when a fierce storm '
         'rolled in. Wind whipped their faces. They kept running. For '
         'Cherchia, it’s a way to make sure that Jones sees him as part of his '
         'team—a true mentor—not just an instructor who’s trying to march him '
         'through the program.\n'
         'After months of running with Cherchia, Jones feels comfortable '
         'enough to jog solo. He can run two to three miles during lunch and '
         'sends Cherchia his “Map My Run” path when he’s done. He’s also '
         'started reaching out to other students on his own to ask them to '
         'work out with him. That’s a huge step for a young man who for years '
         'has been severely anxious about forging friendships.\n'
         '“I just kind of kick-started him and was there with him for a few '
         'weeks,” Cherchia said.\n'
         'The question of life after NITEO has hung over Jones’s head all '
         'semester. So Cherchia came up with a homework assignment: They’d '
         'each make a list of all the possible options, then compare notes. '
         'They talked about Jones going back to community college and '
         'finishing his degree in gaming and computer simulation. He didn’t '
         'feel great about that. They talked about him going to a coding '
         'bootcamp or getting a part-time job.\n'
         'Each option came with its own anxieties.\n'
         'The NITEO program has tried to give Jones tools to manage his fears. '
         'In one class, he did mock interviews. With another project, '
         'PhotoVoice, students learn to capture their challenges—and their '
         'hopes—through a camera lens. And in a session of Open Studio, a '
         'class that incorporates music, comedy, and art into the idea of '
         'wellness, Jones did improv.\n'
         'For someone with social anxiety, it was a bit of a nightmare. Jones '
         'and another student played a game of “Yes, and!” in front of the '
         'class. The premise is simple: Two people have a conversation, and '
         'every sentence has to start with “yes, and …”\n'
         'Jones can’t remember what the scenario even was—he remembers only '
         'how anxious he felt.\n'
         '“I was extremely stressed and in my head. It’s a fuzzy haze,” he '
         'said. It’s something he said he never would have done before. It '
         'wasn’t a massive milestone to him, but it mattered.\n'
         '“It feels to me like a piece of evidence I can use in the future,” '
         'he said. “I can think back on [it] and say, ‘I was able to do that, '
         'so maybe I can push myself and do something else.’”\n'
         'Completing the NITEO program is not a guarantee of a smooth path '
         'ahead.\n'
         'Kerry Ford was part of NITEO’s first cohort in the fall of 2014, '
         'after severe depression forced her to take medical leave from Boston '
         'University. She found the peer group particularly helpful; it was '
         'reassuring to be around people who knew the feeling of being '
         'hospitalized for mental health issues.\n'
         'But after the program, Ford, now 24, began to struggle with alcohol '
         'addiction and continued depression. She was hospitalized several '
         'times. With support and intensive outpatient therapy, Ford '
         'eventually started to ease back into a routine.\n'
         'She signed up for a single class at State University of New York, '
         'Purchase College, in the fall of 2016.\n'
         '“It was very scary and it felt very high-stakes,” she said. Ford '
         'picked up the pace slowly, and is currently taking three classes. '
         'She is set to graduate in the spring of 2018 and has been working at '
         'a high school for students in special education. She often thinks of '
         'the lessons she learned at NITEO when working with those teens.\n'
         '“It’s great to be able to put that knowledge to good use in that '
         'way, too, and to be a part of anyone else’s journey in the way that '
         'NITEO was part of mine,” she said.\n'
         'NITEO surveys alumni about four months after they graduate and has '
         'found that 83 percent are either back in college, working, or both. '
         'Students reported having better emotional ties, stronger academic '
         'skills, less anxiety and depression, and a healthy amount of '
         'hopefulness. And the coaches remain available to help graduates '
         'after the program ends.\n'
         'NITEO has its limits, though. It can give students much-needed '
         'support—but it can’t wipe away the discrimination they may encounter '
         'when they leave.\n'
         'Amanda, a NITEO student who asked to be identified by a pseudonym, '
         'was in the fall semester of her sophomore year when she was '
         'diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2016. She also experiences '
         'depression and while at school, experienced a\xa0manic episode '
         'brought on by antidepressants.\n'
         'Last fall, Amanda had to leave school. She withdrew from all her '
         'classes. She had to leave her internship. She moved out of the '
         'apartment she shared with friends. The abrupt departure from college '
         'was particularly tough for her because her strength at academics has '
         'always been an essential part of her identity.\n'
         'Suddenly, her diagnosis became core to her identity, too.\n'
         'Amanda, now 21, spent a year getting treatment and trying to find '
         'medication that would help. A social worker in a hospital where she '
         'was receiving treatment recommended NITEO. For her, it was the right '
         'next step.\n'
         '“It was about knowing that I was in a place where I was healthy '
         'enough to focus on school and not swing too high or too low,” she '
         'said.\n'
         'Halfway through the semester, she started working on transfer '
         'applications for two colleges. The essay prompt: describe your '
         'reasons for transferring. In her mind, there was only one answer.\n'
         '“When you’ve had to leave school for something that has as much '
         'stigma as leaving for mental health issues, it’s hard to think up '
         'another reason for leaving,” she said. “It’s like getting hit by a '
         'truck.”\n'
         'But when she showed her draft to some of the NITEO staff, they '
         'suggested she avoid delving too far into the details of her mental '
         'health crisis. An admissions office wouldn’t necessarily know what '
         'to do with that kind of information. Amanda tweaked her essay so it '
         'more generically described the challenges of that semester.\n'
         'It was a tough edit to make. She’d worked hard to understand the '
         'destructive role that shame had played in her own mental health. '
         'Now, she felt she had to gloss over her story because the truth '
         'could hurt her chances of going back to college.\n'
         'The program can’t do anything about that.\n'
         'Jones’s anxiety has made it difficult for him to get through an '
         'interview or hang onto a job. He’s had to leave two jobs in the '
         'first few hours. So the idea of giving work another go scared him. '
         'But in December, with the encouragement of his coach at NITEO, he '
         'started a part-time job at a local bookstore.\n'
         'He couldn’t sleep the nights leading up to that first day of work. '
         'He was overwhelmed with apprehension.\n'
         '“I was feeling really bad about it, whether I could do it at all,” '
         'he said.\n'
         'He turned to the NITEO staff for some help managing that anxiety. '
         'They shot him texts throughout his first shift, encouraging him and '
         'checking in to see how he was doing.\n'
         'He called his dad when he made it through the first day—and the '
         'second.\n'
         '“I am thrilled for him. That alone is a huge step,” his dad said. '
         'Jones still feels anxious about his upcoming shifts. But each shift '
         'that passes, each interview he does, each application he sends off, '
         'is another piece of evidence.\n'
         '“I am still extremely nervous. But I know I can do it,” he said.\n'
         'Amanda got her own good news right after Thanksgiving: She’d scored '
         'a place as a transfer student at her first-choice school. She starts '
         'classes in January.\n'
         '“I feel like my life is coming together again,” she said in an email '
         'to STAT.\n'
         'Another six students were also accepted back to school. Two more '
         'decided their next step would be part-time classes and work. One '
         'student will return to Boston University next semester to spend more '
         'time at the center prepping for college classes. And Jones was '
         'working at the bookstore.\n'
         'But they had all made it through the NITEO program. And last week, '
         'with their families and coaches cheering, they graduated.\n'
         'Parents who came to the ceremony saw a highlight reel from that '
         'student-vs.-staff basketball game. And they saw the support system '
         'that had cushioned their children all semester.\n'
         'One at a time, each coach shared a story about working with a '
         'particular student. One called out young woman’s leadership '
         'potential. Another praised a student for making all his peers feel '
         'at home in the program.\n'
         'Jones’s coach praised him for having pushed himself beyond what he '
         'thought was possible: He had showed up to nearly every single social '
         'event.\n'
         'After the graduation, Jones headed home. He’ll be back at the '
         'bookstore this week.\n'
         'And he just learned that he’s been selected as a peer mentor for the '
         'NITEO program. He’ll start advising other students in the spring.\n'

 'description': 'Mounting evidence shows that relationships should be a public '
                'health priority',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'To Combat Loneliness, Promote Social Health',
 'text': 'Last week, the United Kingdom appointed a Minister for Loneliness to '
         'address the finding that nine million British people often or always '
         'feel lonely. To some, this may come as a surprise.\n'
         'It should not. Loneliness and social isolation are on the rise, '
         'leading many to call it an epidemic. In recent decades, the number '
         'of people with zero confidants has tripled, and most adults do not '
         'belong to a local community group. Consequently, more than one third '
         'of Americans over the age of 45 report feeling lonely, with '
         'prevalence especially high among those under 25 and over 65 years '
         'old. “We live in the most technologically connected age in the '
         'history of civilization,” writes the former U.S. Surgeon General, '
         'Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, “yet rates of loneliness have doubled since the '
         '1980s.”\n'
         'While this alarming trend has grown, so has understanding of its '
         'impact. By now, the evidence is abundant and decisive: social '
         'connection significantly affects health. When you believe that you '
         'have people in your life who care about you, and you interact with '
         'them regularly, you are better off. For instance, you may be less '
         'likely to catch a cold, have a stroke or heart disease, slip into '
         'early cognitive decline, and develop depression. You may even be '
         'more likely to overcome socio-economic disadvantages, recover '
         'quickly from illness, and live longer. A study at Harvard University '
         'that followed hundreds of people for 75 years identified the quality '
         'of people’s relationships as the single clearest predictor of their '
         'physical health, longevity, and quality of life.\n'
         'But the threat of loneliness is still largely absent from common '
         'health discourse, medical training and practice, and public '
         'awareness. It’s time to establish a dedicated discipline to further '
         'study, develop initiatives around, and promote social health—how '
         'well a person forms and maintains relationships, receives and '
         'reciprocates support, and feels connected to others. In the same way '
         'that mental health has risen up in prominence, yielding more and '
         'better research, treatment, and advocacy, so too should social '
         'health.\n'
         'Indeed, researchers led by Julianne Holt-Lunstad at Brigham Young '
         'University recently evaluated social connection using widely '
         'accepted public health criteria, including size, severity, and '
         'urgency. They then compared it to well-established public health '
         'priorities that receive considerable resources across public and '
         'private sectors, such as nutrition. Despite not receiving similar '
         'resources, they concluded, social connection matches and in some '
         'cases exceeds other priorities in impact. (Other research suggests '
         'that loneliness has a comparable effect on health as smoking '
         'cigarettes daily and is worse than being obese or sedentary.)\n'
         'Therefore, the authors propose that we take action by applying the '
         'same framework as existing public health priorities: First, convene '
         'experts to evaluate the literature periodically and make practical, '
         'evidence-based recommendations. Second, align on population-level '
         'measures to track progress, forecast problems, and identify at-risk '
         'groups. Last, build coalitions that span the individual to the '
         'societal, including local healthcare settings, nonprofits, and '
         'government agencies.\n'
         'Already a social health movement is gaining momentum, with numerous '
         'initiatives pointing the way for future efforts to follow. '
         'Designating a Minister to develop policies and catalyze innovation '
         'around the issue, as the U.K. has done, is an excellent example and '
         'will be interesting to follow in the years to come. But, as the '
         'researchers noted, it is important to diversify the approaches to '
         'bolstering social health.\n'
         'For instance, the Togetherness Program created by CareMore, a health '
         'plan and delivery system in the United States, is taking a medical '
         'approach. Dr. Sachin H. Jain, their president, has stated that they '
         'believe loneliness “should be addressed by physicians, nurses, and '
         'other clinicians as a treatable medical condition.” Among their '
         'efforts, they screen for loneliness during appointments, have '
         'regular phone conversations and home visits with at-risk senior '
         'patients to show they care, and provide informal social hubs at '
         'their clinics to foster connection.\n'
         'The Campaign to End Loneliness takes a more grassroots advocacy '
         'approach. They have built up a network of over 2,500 organizations '
         'and people in the United Kingdom who campaign to policy-makers and '
         'commissioners. They actively spread awareness on social media, '
         'facilitate shared learning among the network members, and partner '
         'with academics and specialists to make research actionable.\n'
         'These initiatives mark the beginning of a shift toward seeing health '
         'as not only physical or mental, but also social. Elevating '
         'relationships in the public health realm through a variety of '
         'individual, community, and societal efforts holds the potential to '
         'significantly improve population health. You can start exercising '
         'your own social health by calling a friend or family member you '
         'haven’t spoken with in a while or introducing yourself to a neighbor '
         'you haven’t met yet. It may just improve your health—and theirs.\n',

         'Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\n'
         'An estimated\xa01 in 9 women\xa0experience symptoms of postpartum '
         'depression. These symptoms—including mood swings, fatigue and '
         'reduced interest in activities—can make it difficult for mothers to '
         'bond with their newborns.\n'
         'Early relationships between mothers and their infants can\xa0'
         'influence health\xa0across the lifespan, for better or worse. For '
         'example, adults who report more household dysfunction and abuse '
         'during their childhood are\xa0more likely to suffer disease as '
         'adults. Those with healthy and supportive relationships during early '
         'life\xa0are better at handling stress and regulating their '
         'emotions.\n'

         'paper, published in November, shows a possible link between '
         'increasing depression symptoms in mothers and cellular damage in '
         'their infants.\n'
         'How does stress affect our cells? One area of burgeoning research '

         'outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, '
         'cancer, obesity and\xa0even death.\n'
         'Interestingly, telomeres can degrade more quickly when a person '
         'suffers from\xa0psychological stress. When we experience stress, our '
         'bodies release a hormone called cortisol, which influences our '
         'emotional responses as well as our energy metabolism, learning and '
         'memory. This may be one\xa0mechanism\xa0that connects psychological '
         'stress to telomere length and ultimately physical health. Cells that '
         'are exposed to cortisol have shorter telomeres and\xa0less '
         'telomerase, which is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the ends '
         'of telomeres.\n'
         'This process may explain how psychological stress is converted to '
         'biological “wear and tear.” Indeed,\xa0adolescents with depressed '
         'mothers\xa0have heightened cortisol stress responses and shorter '
         'telomeres than their peers, even when the adolescents themselves are '
         'not depressed.\n'
         'We examined whether increasing maternal depressive symptoms affected '
         'infant stress and later cell health.\n'
         'Infancy is a sensitive period, when individuals are strongly '
         'influenced by their environment. One way to study how early stress '
         'may influence health is to look at how infants respond to their '
         'parents’ stress. Studies suggest that infants exposed to maternal '
         'depression may be\xa0less likely to engage socially and experience '
         'more negative emotion.\n'
         'For our study we recruited 48 mothers with 12-week-old infants and '
         'followed these families until the infants were 18 months old. At 6 '
         'and 12 months of age, the infants were brought to the lab to engage '
         'in mildly stressful tasks. For example, in the “still face '
         'experiment,” mothers alternated between playing with their infant '
         'and not reacting to their infant’s bids for attention. This can\xa0'
         'elicit stress\xa0in infants, as they rely on their caregivers to not '
         'only feed them, but to also soothe their emotions.\n'
         'During each visit, we measured infants’ stress by collecting saliva '
         'samples to look at changes in cortisol. We also collected '
         'information on how many depression symptoms mothers were feeling. '
         'Finally, when the infants were 18 months of age, we brought the '
         'families back into our lab and collected saliva to measure the '
         'length of the infant’s telomeres.\n'
         'Worsening depression symptoms in mothers related to greater infant '
         'cortisol stress responses between 6 and 12 months of age. In '
         'addition, infants with higher cortisol stress responses were more '
         'likely to have shorter telomeres at 18 months of age, indicating '
         'greater cellular wear and tear.\n'
         'While these findings are preliminary and should be replicated with a '
         'larger group of infants, our results highlight how patterns of '
         'health across the lifespan may be influenced in the first 18 months '
         'of life. This early stress may put young children on track for the '
         'early onset of poor health outcomes.\n'
         'The silver lining is that infancy is a sensitive developmental '
         'period, when humans are especially responsive to their environments. '
         'Fostering positive experiences between infants and their mothers—as '
         'well as providing affordable, scientifically supported treatment '
         'services for mothers experiencing depression—may allow infants to '
         'move toward a healthier life trajectory.\n'
         'In our view, these results show how important it is to fund '
         'effective maternal mental health treatment and early childhood '
         'policies.\n'

         'Secrets',
 'text': 'Elvis Alonzo began smoking cannabis as a last resort. Three years in '
         'the Marine Corps and 13 years with the Glendale Police Department in '
         'Arizona—where he was exposed to murders, suicides and people dying '
         'in his arms—had left him emotionally crippled.* Toward the end of '
         'his police service, doctors diagnosed Alonzo with post-traumatic '
         'stress disorder and prescribed various medications to temper his '
         'nightmares and flashbacks. The drugs “turned me into a zombie,” he '
         'says. “I was so out of it that I couldn’t even drive, so they (the '
         'police department) had to medically retire me.” Alonzo stopped '
         'showering. His wife left him, and he nearly lost his house. Then a '
         'friend suggested he try marijuana to relieve his symptoms. “It’s '
         'been a godsend,” he says. “It curbs my anxiety, and it makes me '
         'sleep fantastic for at least four hours. It needs to be studied.”\r\n'
         '\xa0\r\n'
         'Thousands of military veterans have echoed Alonzo’s claim for years. '
         'They have pressured federal and state legislators to legalize '
         'medicinal cannabis and ease rules on research into the plant’s '
         'apparent therapeutic properties, arguing that it could help reduce '
         'suicide rates among former soldiers. Backed by overwhelming public '
         'support for broader legalization, their demands are starting to '
         'resonate in statehouses across the country. This past November, New '
         'York Gov. Andrew Cuomo chose Veterans Day to make PTSD a qualifying '
         'condition for the state’s tightly controlled medical marijuana '
         'program. New York joined seven other states this year—and 27 '
         'overall—that include PTSD in their lists of conditions that qualify '
         'for medical cannabis.\n'
         'But some cannabis researchers—while acknowledging the urgency of '
         'finding better PTSD treatments—remain skeptical of legalizing too '
         'quickly and warn that marijuana’s pharmacological properties remain '
         'largely unknown. Still, scientists have long been focusing on two of '
         'the plant’s more than 120 active compounds as possible treatments '
         'for PTSD symptoms. They are looking at tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, '
         "which is the plant's principal psychoactive ingredient, and "
         'cannabidiol, or CBD, which is non-intoxicating and has drawn '
         'interest for possible medical applications. Concentrations of both '
         'can vary widely between different genetic lines of cannabis, and '
         'even between individual plants.\n'
         'Of the two compounds, THC is a bit better understood. It binds to '
         'specific receptors on brain cells that help regulate mood, sleep '
         'patterns and pain perception. Scientists also believe it interacts '
         'with receptors in the brain’s emotional centers—the amygdala and '
         'hippocampus—to reduce anxiety, which may help explain Alonzo’s '
         'reaction to cannabis. THC research involving PTSD, although scant, '
         'has shown some promise. A 2009 clinical trial in Canada showed that '
         'the nighttime administration of THC reduced the frequency and '
         'intensity of nightmares in 72 percent of the 47 patients studied. '
         'But other trials have presented more mixed results. They demonstrate '
         'that THC’s effectiveness in reducing anxiety and increasing sleep '
         'quality depends on dose size, with lower doses improving sleep '
         'quality and higher doses producing higher levels of anxiety—and '
         'negative long-term outcomes.\n'
         'Research into CBD remains hazy, partly because it triggers so many '
         'biochemical pathways and produces wide-ranging results. It appears '
         'to effectively treat some forms of epilepsy, but scientists do not '
         'know why. They have a better sense of how it may relieve some users’ '
         'anxiety—by targeting and boosting the signal of 5-HT1A serotonin '
         'receptors on brain cells. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, helps '
         'regulate mood and is associated with feelings of well-being. And '
         'CBD, a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, also increases '
         'gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter '
         'that produces a calming effect when amplified. But study outcomes '
         'are still largely inchoate, marked by small sample sizes, narrow '
         'methodological controls and contradictory findings. Although 29 '
         'states have legalized medical or recreational cannabis since 1996, '
         'the federal government continues to officially prohibit the drug and '
         'has done little to facilitate research into its medicinal '
         'potential.\n'
         'Despite the limited research, many scientists have recently shifted '
         'focus from THC to CBD—even if many patients have not—says Marcel '
         'Bonn-Miller, a psychology and psychiatry professor at the University '
         "of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. “Think of CBD as a "
         'shotgun. It hits so many receptors that people are still trying to '
         'understand it,” Bonn-Miller explains. “If you want to actually treat '
         'PTSD, most of the evidence is pointing toward CBD. But most people '
         'with PTSD are gravitating toward [marijuana] products with high THC '
         'levels, which may help in the short-term but are likely to worsen '
         'their symptoms over time.”\n'
         'Bonn-Miller and psychiatrist Sue Sisley, a former professor at the '
         'University of Arizona College of Medicine, are trying to address '
         'these issues. Using cannabis provided by the federal government and '
         'a protocol approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, they '
         'are leading the first-ever randomized control trial on the efficacy '
         'of marijuana for PTSD. The study, funded with a nearly $2.2-million '
         'grant from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, '
         'is examining four different strains of cannabis in '
         'treatment-resistant military veterans: a high-THC batch, a high-CBD '
         'batch, a blend with equal concentrations of THC and CBD, and a '
         'placebo control. Sisley notes that a key hallmark of PTSD is '
         'insomnia, usually blamed on nightmares and flashbacks—and that if '
         'cannabis can help veterans initiate sleep and stay asleep, that is a '
         'victory in itself. “Until we unblind and analyze all the data, we '
         'can’t make any conclusions,” Sisley says, referring to the Arizona '
         'study. “But I can tell you that we have had almost 30 veterans who '
         'have completed the 10-week protocol and the study is progressing '
         'well.”\n'
         'Bonn-Miller is also the principal investigator in an observational '
         'study on 150 PTSD patients in Denver, Colorado, funded by a grant '
         'from the University of Pennsylvania. Half of the subjects will use '
         'cannabis obtained from a dispensary, and half will not consume '
         'cannabis. Bonn-Miller is tracking participant symptoms over the '
         'course of a year—with assessments at three, six, nine and 12 '
         'months—while scientifically testing the cannabis that users choose '
         'to consume, to determine if there are certain cannabinoid '
         'concentrations that are more helpful than others for mitigating PTSD '
         'symptoms. The only criteria is that participants acquire their '
         'cannabis from local dispensaries, so that researchers can easily '
         'test it. What most interests Bonn-Miller is that some participants '
         'may switch groups—some non-users at the start of the study may begin '
         'using cannabis, and previous users may stop. This will allow '
         'Bonn-Miller to examine the changes that cannabis use produces in '
         "PTSD symptoms in real time. “It's early. We really don't understand "
         'the mechanisms of action that well at this point,” Bonn-Miller says '
         'of marijuana’s pharmacology, before underlining what he sees as the '
         "plant's medical potential: “Something that can reduce seizures, "
         'improve anxiety and also reduce inflammation,” he says. “All in the '
         'same drug!”\n'

         'behavioral health problems from worthless interventions.\n'
         'The program, called the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs '
         'and Practices, was launched in 1997 and is run by the Substance '
         'Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Its website lists '
         '453 programs in behavioral health—aimed at everything from addiction '
         'and parenting to HIV prevention, teen depression, and '
         'suicide-hotline training—that have been shown, by rigorous outcomes '
         'measures, to be effective and not quackery. The most recent were '
         'added last September.\n'
         'In an email dated Jan. 4 and sent to program developers,\xa0the '
         'contractor hired by SAMHSA to work on the registry said, “It is with '
         'great regret that we write to inform you that on December 28, 2017, '
         'we received notification from SAMHSA that the NREPP contract is '
         'being terminated for the convenience of the government. This '
         'cancellation means that we can no longer make any updates to your '
         'program profile. … We are deeply saddened by the government’s sudden '
         'decision to end the NREPP contract, under which we have been able to '
         'provide and strengthen science-based information about mental health '
         'and substance use treatment and prevention programs.”\n'
         'A recipient shared the email with STAT. The contractor, Development '
         'Services Group Inc., of Bethesda, Md., did not reply to a request '
         'for comment. A SAMHSA spokesman did not reply to questions sent by '
         'phone and email. The agency is part of the Department of Health and '
         'Human Services.\n'
         'The\xa0website\xa0of the now-frozen registry has not been taken '
         'down. In an online statement, SAMHSA said future work on the '
         'registry, including vetting new applications, would be moved '
         'in-house “to reconfigure its approach to identifying and '
         'disseminating evidence-based practice and programs.”\n'
         'Despite the inclusion of the phrase “evidence-based,” the statement '
         'did not assuage critics’ concerns. Because SAMHSA has not explained '
         'how or when it will pick up the registry work, “I’m pessimistic,” '
         'said psychology professor Warren Throckmorton, of Grove City College '
         'in Pennsylvania, who teaches a seminar that includes lessons on '
         'evidence-based programs and practices. “Why did they stop something '
         'before they had something to put in its place? Why stop what was '
         'working reasonably well?”\n'
         'The administration\xa0said last month\xa0that it had advised '
         'agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to '
         'avoid using seven words—including “evidence-based,” “science-based,” '
         '“fetus,” and “transgender”—in budget documents and to instead use '
         'language that wouldn’t antagonize members of Congress.\n'
         'The guidance, for example, suggested that instead of describing a '
         'policy or decision as “evidence-based,” the CDC say that it “bases '
         'its recommendations on science in consideration with community '
         'standards and wishes.”\n'
         'But critics alarmed by the SAMHSA decision said it suggests that '
         'what they described as the administration’s skepticism about '
         'scientific evidence has now been extended.\n'
         'Just as mainstream medicine has been embracing an evidence-based '
         'approach (testing\xa0assumptions that, say, arthroscopic surgery for '
         'knee osteoarthritis works) so that patients do not receive useless '
         'care, so has behavioral health, which includes mental health as well '
         'as things such as parent-child relationships and social functioning. '
         'Behavioral health has lagged behind, however, because some of the '
         'problems it addresses are partly subjective, making it “easy to '
         'convince yourself that something is effective when it’s not,” said '
         'Throckmorton. That’s harder to demonstrate for interventions meant '
         'to help with\xa0parent-child interactions than, say, to\xa0treat '
         'cancer.\n'
         'Throckmorton said his interest in the field grew from his '
         'realization that “change therapy”—to alter people’s sexual '
         'orientation—has no scientific basis.\n'
         'By identifying programs whose effectiveness is supported by '
         'evidence, the registry “has been a gold seal of approval,” said a '
         'physician at a child health program who asked not to be identified '
         'because he did not want to jeopardize his SAMHSA funding. And there '
         'is considerable work still to be done in spreading evidence-based '
         'programs: Only 3 percent of children with problems ranging from '
         'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to disruptive behavior to '
         'suicidality receive evidence-based services, he said, partly because '
         'scientifically valid programs often have a high price tag.\n'

         'appear, including\xa0less sleep\xa0and a\xa0higher risk of '
         'suicide-related outcomes\xa0such as depression and making suicide '
         'plans.\n'
         'The solution, then, seems easy: Limit the amount of time the device '
         'can be used and how it can be used. This works out fairly well for '
         'Apple;\xa0most of their profit is locked in once someone buys an '
         'iPhone or iPad, regardless of how much the owner uses it.\n'
         'The problem is that most teens who are handed a smartphone aren’t '
         'going to use it for just an hour or two per day. Research suggests '
         'that digital media stimulates\xa0the same brain chemicals and '
         'regions as other addictive products. Although some teens are able to '
         'limit their use, a substantial number end up spending the majority '
         'of their leisure time with their devices, which—as noted '
         'earlier—could lead to mental health issues.\n'
         'Some have pointed out that\xa0parents can use third-party apps\xa0'
         'such as Kidslox or Norton Family Premier to limit time spent on the '
         'phone or on social media sites. Although some parents might find '
         'these apps helpful, others might be overwhelmed by the setup process '
         'or find the download fees too expensive. Clever teens might also '
         'find ways around these apps.\n'
         'But what if Apple were to include the ability to limit screen time '
         'in the iPhone’s operating system?\n'
         'For example, when registering and setting up the phone, Apple could '
         'include an option to select the age of the user. If you say the '
         'phone is for a 12-year-old, it could give parents the option to '
         'restrict the apps used, shut down the phone at night, limit the '
         'number of hours it can be used and permit communication with a '
         'preapproved list of phone numbers. As the child grows older, these '
         'restrictions could be changed or lifted. Making this part of the iOS '
         'would seamlessly integrate safety for children and teens into the '
         'iPhone—and seamless integration has always been Apple’s calling '
         'card.\n'
         'This has another benefit for Apple: Parents might be more willing to '
         'buy their children smartphones if they were easier to regulate. '
         'Outside of buying an old-school flip phone—which are increasingly '
         'difficult to find—there’s currently no easy way to give a child a '
         'cellphone without opening up the world of unlimited internet access, '
         'constant social media and endless evenings spent arguing over '
         'putting the phone away at dinner.\n'
         'As the parent of an 11-year-old, I would be much more comfortable '
         'giving my daughter a smartphone if I knew she wouldn’t be bullied on '
         'it, see things she shouldn’t see or stare at it for six hours a '
         'day.\n'
         'Social media companies like\xa0Facebook also have something to '
         'answer for here\xa0–\xa0and they know it. Given links between '
         'advertising revenue and time spent on the site, balancing profit and '
         'safety will be a tougher task for them.\n'
         'But for Apple, it’s arguably a win-win: The safer their product is '
         'for kids, the more they could sell. So why not make it safer by '
         'offering parents more tools and options?\n'

 'description': 'Cases of criminal behavior after brain injury raise profound '
                'questions about the neuroscience of free will.\xa0',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'How Responsible are Killers with Brain Damage?',
 'text': 'Charles Whitman lived a fairly unremarkable life until August 1, '
         '1966, when he murdered 16 people including his wife and mother. What '
         'transformed this 25-year-old Eagle Scout and Marine into one of '
         'modern America’s first and deadliest school shooters? His autopsy '
         'suggests one troubling explanation: Charles Whitman had a brain '
         'tumor pressing on his amygdala, a region of the brain crucial for '
         'emotion and behavioral control.\n'
         'Can murder really be a symptom of brain disease? And if our brains '
         'can be hijacked so easily, do we really have free will?\n'
         'Neuroscientists are shedding new light on these questions by '
         'uncovering how brain lesions can lead to criminal behavior. A recent '
         'study contains the first systematic review of 17 known cases where '
         'criminal behavior was preceded by the onset of a brain lesion. Is '
         'there one brain region consistently involved in cases of criminal '
         'behavior? No—the researchers found that the lesions were widely '
         'distributed throughout different brain regions. However, all the '
         'lesions were part of the same functional network, located on '
         'different parts of a single circuit that normally allows neurons '
         'throughout the brain to cooperate with each other on specific '
         'cognitive tasks. In an era of increasing excitement about mapping '
         'the brain’s “connectome,” this finding fits with our growing '
         'understanding of complex brain functions as residing not in discrete '
         'brain regions, but in densely connected networks of neurons spread '
         'throughout different parts of the brain.\n'
         'Interestingly, the ‘criminality-associated network’ identified by '
         'the researchers is closely related to networks previously linked '
         'with moral decision making. The network is most closely associated '
         'with two specific components of moral psychology: theory of mind and '
         'value-based decision making. Theory of mind refers to the capacity '
         'to understand other people’s points of view, beliefs, and emotions. '
         'This helps you appreciate, for instance, how your actions would make '
         'another person scared or hurt. Value-based decision making refers to '
         'the ability to judge the value of specific actions or their '
         'consequences. This helps you see not only what the outcomes of your '
         'actions will be, but whether those actions and outcomes are good or '
         'bad. The letters written by Charles Whitman on the eve of his '
         'killing spree provide a chilling window into a mind losing the '
         'ability to understand good, bad, and other people: “It was after '
         'much thought that I decided to kill my wife, Kathy…I love her '
         'dearly, and she has been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever '
         'hope to have. I cannot rationally pinpoint any specific reason for '
         'doing this.”\n'
         'This research raises troubling questions about Charles Whitman and '
         'the other subjects in the study—and for all of us. If their actions '
         'were caused by brain damage and a disrupted neural network, were '
         'they acting under their own free will? Should they be held morally '
         'responsible for their actions and found guilty in a court of law? '
         'Should we see them as patients or perpetrators—or both?\n'
         'Some scientists have followed cases like Charles Whitman’s down the '
         'slippery slope, reaching the most extreme conclusion: that by '
         'uncovering the biological causes of behavior, neuroscience shows '
         'that “free will, as we ordinarily understand it, is an illusion”.\n'
         'But these arguments depend on a faulty conception of free will. Free '
         'will should not be understood as a mysterious ability to cause '
         'actions separate from our brain activity. In fact just the opposite '
         'might be true: that free will requires certain connections between '
         'our brains and our actions. After all, our brains are the biological '
         'basis of our identity, housing our memories, our values, our '
         'imagination, our ability to reason—in other words, all the '
         'capacities necessary to make choices that are uniquely our own, and '
         'to carry out actions according to our own will.\n'
         'This understanding of free will allows us to ask more sophisticated '
         'questions about the connection between the brain and criminal '
         'behavior when evaluating cases like Charles Whitman’s. Instead of '
         'just pointing to the obvious fact that an action had a neural cause '
         '(every action does!), we can ask whether a person’s specific '
         'neurologic injury impaired the psychological capacities necessary '
         'for free will—imagining possible courses of action, weighing '
         'relevant reasons, perceiving the moral features of actions and '
         'outcomes, making decisions that align with our values, and '
         'controlling behavior against competing impulses.\n'
         'The specific components of moral psychology disrupted by lesions in '
         'the criminality-associated network may indeed interfere with these '
         'abilities: value-based decision making and theory of mind are '
         'important for grasping the moral impact of our actions and '
         'understanding how they will be experienced by other people. If a '
         'person has genuine impairments in these capabilities, then they '
         'possess only a diminished form of free will. Future research should '
         'evaluate more robustly the degree to which these and other '
         'psychological capacities are truly impaired in patients with lesions '
         'in this network.\n'
         'When moving from the question of free will to issues of moral '
         'responsibility and legal guilt, it is important to evaluate each '
         'case in light of the wide array of factors beyond neurologic injury '
         'that influence behavior. Previous research has demonstrated that '
         'criminal behavior is impacted by genetics, childhood mistreatment, '
         'low self-esteem during adolescence, lack of parental support,\xa0 '
         'social and economic disadvantage, and racial discrimination. Digging '
         'deeper into Charles Whitman’s case, we might wonder whether his '
         'extraordinarily strict father, or his fascination with guns as early '
         'as age 2, contributed to his later violent turn. The lesson is that '
         'human behavior is complex and a brain lesion is neither necessary '
         'nor sufficient for criminal behavior: after all, there are nearly '
         '700,000 people living with brain tumors in the US and approximately '
         '800,000 people have strokes every year, but the known cases leading '
         'to criminal behavior number in the dozens. Further research would be '
         'helpful in determining the likelihood that patients who suffer brain '
         'lesions in the ‘criminality-associated network’ actually go on to '
         'commit crimes, with the expectation that this kind of impairment '
         'will emerge as one of many factors increasing the risk of criminal '
         'behavior.\n'
         'The fact that violence can be a symptom of brain disease shows not '
         'that free will is an illusion, but that free will can be injured '
         'just like other human abilities. These rare cases of dysfunction '
         'allow us to see more clearly that our healthy brains endow us with '
         'remarkable capacities to imagine, reason, and act freely.\n',

 'name': 'A Drug Widely Used to Treat PTSD Symptoms Has Failed a Rigorous '
         'Trial',
 'text': 'Thousands of people with post-traumatic stress disorder have taken '
         'the drug prazosin to ease the nightmares and disturbances that stalk '
         'their sleep.\n'
         'Numerous\xa0studies\xa0have shown the drug to be effective at '
         'controlling those episodes. But a team of researchers from the '
         'Department of Veterans Affairs, seeking to collect more evidence, '
         'set out to study the sustained effectiveness of the treatment. They '
         'organized a large, lengthy, multisite trial—the most rigorous type '
         'of trial.\n'
         'The drug was no better than a placebo.\n'
         'The trial “seemed like a good idea, but you know, live and learn,” '
         'said Dr. Murray Raskind, a lead researcher on the trial, which\xa0'
         'was described\xa0Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n'
         'Some researchers not involved with the study were quick to say that '
         'clinicians should still prescribe prazosin for some patients; '
         'Raskind, director of the VA Northwest Network Mental Illness '
         'Research, Education, and Clinical Center, agreed. There are few '
         'other treatment options and there is evidence supporting the use of '
         'the drug, a generic that was originally approved to treat high blood '
         'pressure but is prescribed off label to control nightmares and '
         'improve sleep quality in patients with PTSD.\n'
         '“I don’t think it should change clinical practice—there are six '
         'positive studies and one negative study,” said Raskind, who '
         'described the research team as “humbled” by the results. He '
         'estimated that 15 percent to 20 percent of veterans in the VA system '
         'with PTSD are currently prescribed prazosin, and said he did not '
         'expect that to change.\n'
         'But the study has already had some reverberations. Last year, citing '
         'the then-unpublished results of the new study, the VA and Department '
         'of Defense\xa0wrote that\xa0there was “insufficient evidence to '
         'recommend for or against the use of prazosin as … therapy for '
         'nightmares or sleep disturbances associated with PTSD.”\n'
         'It should be up to clinicians and their patients to decide whether '
         'to stop or continue the use of prazosin, the officials said, noting '
         'that patients who stop taking it and whose symptoms return might '
         'need to restart the therapy.\n'
         'For some people with PTSD, the trouble isn’t so much getting to '
         'sleep, it’s staying that way. Nightmares and other disturbances are '
         'common symptoms.\n'
         'Prazosin is thought to help by blocking the alpha1 receptor for '
         'norepinephrine, a chemical that boosts the body’s arousal in '
         'response to stimuli. The receptors may become more sensitive in '
         'combat settings, which can prove lifesaving there, but “just because '
         'you come home doesn’t mean this upregulation of the alpha1 receptor '
         'goes away,” Raskind said.\n'
         'The new study was run over six months at 12 VA medical centers with '
         'about 300 participants, half of whom were given a placebo and half '
         'of whom were give prazosin. Patients in both arms of the study saw '
         'mild improvements in sleep quality and in the frequency and severity '
         'of nightmares, but there was no significant difference between the '
         'improvements in the different study groups.\n'
         'Enrollment was limited to people who were clinically stable, meaning '
         'they were not drinking heavily, facing family conflicts, or '
         'experiencing suicidal or violent thoughts, Raskind said. Because of '
         'the long duration of the study, researchers didn’t want to risk '
         'exposing such patients to a placebo; some psychiatrists didn’t want '
         'their patients enrolled in the study at all for that reason.\n'
         'But by focusing on stable patients, Raskind and his colleagues may '
         'have set themselves up for a negative result, he said. Perhaps, they '
         'speculated, only patients experiencing some distress respond to '
         'prazosin.\n'
         'The trial participants had, on average, low blood pressure, which '
         'could also help explain why they did not see significant improvement '
         'in their sleep. In\xa0a separate 2016 study, Raskind and colleagues '
         'found that people with high blood pressure were more likely to '
         'respond to prazosin, perhaps because higher blood pressure serves as '
         'a proxy for how active the adrenaline and arousal system is.\n'
         'Even though it was a negative trial, the new study still offers '
         'insights as researchers try to understand the full complexity of '
         'PTSD, said Dr. Matthew Friedman, who led the National Center for '
         'PTSD for more than two decades and who was not involved in the new '
         'study.\n'
         '“I really think that we are beginning to recognize that sweeping '
         'everything under one PTSD rug may be more than one rug can cover, or '
         'should cover,” said Friedman, a psychiatry professor at Dartmouth’s '
         'Geisel School of Medicine. “By better defining what the syndrome is '
         'that we’re treating, we can better identify medications that could '
         'be helpful.”\n'
         'PTSD was traditionally thought of as an anxiety disorder, but it can '
         'also manifest as depression or disassociation or reckless behavior, '
         'experts said. The different presentations of the condition that will '
         'likely require different treatments.\n'
         '“I do hope that this trial doesn’t necessarily prevent clinicians '
         'from using prazosin as one of the tools in their arsenals,” said '
         'Anne Germain, the director of the Military Sleep Tactics and '
         'Resilience Research Team at the University of Pittsburgh School of '
         'Medicine, who was not involved with the study. “I still think that '
         'some people can benefit from it, but we just need to do a much '
         'better job of having personalized, predictive treatment algorithms '
         'to help people in the end.”\n'

         'disorder, according to a large study of postmortem brain tissue. The '
         'findings appear today in Science.\n'
         'All three conditions show an activation of genes in star-shaped '
         'brain cells called astrocytes, and suppression of genes that '
         'function at synapses, the junctions between neurons. The autism '
         'brains also show a unique increase in the expression of genes '
         'specific to immune cells called microglia.\n'
         '“This study demonstrates for the first time that [gene expression] '
         'can be used to robustly define cross-disorder phenotypes that are '
         'shared and distinct,” says lead investigator Daniel Geschwind, '
         'professor of neurology, psychiatry and human genetics at the '
         'University of California, Los Angeles. “And these phenotypes are '
         'related to the molecular and cellular pathways that likely have gone '
         'awry.”\n'
         'People who have one of these conditions may have features in common, '
         'such as language problems, irritability and aggression. They also '
         'share certain genetic variants that raise the risk of the '
         'conditions.\n'
         'The new work shows that the overlap among risk variants is related '
         'to the commonality in their gene expression patterns. This hints '
         'that the variants raise risk in part by turning on or off certain '
         'sets of genes in the brain.\n'
         '“We’re seeing all these studies coming out finding links between '
         'genetic variants and psychiatric [conditions], but how do we go from '

         'psychological sciences at Birkbeck University of London, who was not '
         'involved in the study. “This paper begins to fill that gap.”\n'
         'In 2011, Geschwind’s team characterized gene expression in '
         'postmortem brain tissue from 19 individuals with autism and 17 '
         'controls. The new work, which incorporates datasets from nine other '
         'studies, expands that analysis to 50 people with autism, 159 with '
         'schizophrenia, 94 with bipolar disorder, 87 with depression, 17 with '
         'alcoholism and 293 controls. All of the tissue came from the '
         'cerebral cortex, the brain’s outer layer.\n'
         'The researchers found that the gene expression signatures in the '
         'autism brains overlap with those of both the schizophrenia and '
         'bipolar disorder brains. They confirmed this result in independent '
         'sets of brain samples from 24 people with autism, 315 with '
         'schizophrenia and 94 with bipolar disorder.\n'
         'By contrast, none of the patterns common to autism, schizophrenia '
         'and bipolar overlap with those of alcoholism or those seen in gut '
         'samples from 197 people with inflammatory bowel disease—suggesting '
         'that the signatures do not reflect poor overall health and are '
         'specific to the brain.\n'
         'In 2016, a different team also found that autism shares a gene '
         'expression signature with schizophrenia. Those researchers found no '
         'overlap with bipolar disorder. However, their study involved fewer '
         'brains—about 30 for each of the conditions—so they might have missed '
         'a statistically significant link, says Dan Arking, associate '
         'professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. '
         'Arking led the 2016 study but was not involved in the new work.\n'
         'To home in on molecular pathways, the researchers grouped genes into '
         '‘modules’ that show similar rises and dips across the brains. Each '
         'of these modules comprises genes specific to a cell type or to a '
         'function, such as communication between neurons.\n'
         'The analysis revealed that autism, schizophrenia and bipolar brains '
         'show low levels of gene expression in three modules characteristic '
         'of neurons.\n'
         'Two of these modules are important for neuronal communication; the '
         'other one is involved in the function of mitochondria, which '
         'generate energy for cells. All three conditions also show an uptick '
         'in the expression of genes in an ‘astrocyte’ module.\n'
         'These shared patterns may spring from a set of DNA variants common '
         'to all three conditions.\n'
         'To explore this possibility, the team gathered data from genome-wide '
         'association studies (GWAS), which reveal common variants—those '
         'present in more than 1 percent of the population—associated with the '
         'conditions. (For autism, the researchers relied on an '
         'as-yet-unpublished GWAS analysis of a Danish cohort that includes '
         '8,605 people with autism and 19,526 controls.)\n'
         'For each pair of psychiatric conditions, they found a strong '
         'correlation between the degree of overlap among DNA variants and the '
         'extent of overlap in gene expression signatures.\n'
         'Common variants linked to autism and schizophrenia tend to pop up in '
         'the three neuronal modules. Genes known to harbor spontaneous '
         'mutations linked to these conditions also fall within one of the '
         'synapse modules.\n'
         'These results suggest that many variants linked to autism and '
         'schizophrenia dampen the expression of genes involved in signaling '
         'at synapses.\n'
         '“This is starting to pinpoint some of the common pathways,” says '
         'Tomasz Nowakowski, assistant professor of anatomy at the University '
         'of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\n'
         'Autism brains alone show a spike in the expression of genes '
         'associated with microglia, the researchers found.\n'
         'That finding is somewhat surprising, because microglia have also '
         'been implicated in schizophrenia, says Stephan Sanders, assistant '
         'professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San '
         'Francisco, who was not involved in the study.\n'
         'Characterizing the gene expression patterns of microglia and other '
         'individual brain cells, rather than the patterns in a chunk of '
         'tissue, might lead to more refined results, says Nowakowski, who has '
         'studied gene expression in single cells in the developing human '
         'brain.\n'
         'Geschwind and his team are exploring how the gene expression '

         'Secrets about Mental Illness',
 'text': 'Millions of Americans who suffer from bipolar disorder depend on '
         'lithium. The medication has been prescribed for half a century to '
         'help stabilize patients’ moods and prevent manic or depressive '
         'episodes. Yet what it does in the brain—and why it does not work for '
         'some people—has remained largely mysterious.\n'
         'But last year San Diego–based researchers uncovered new details '
         'about how lithium may alter moods, thanks to an approach recently '
         'championed by a small number of scientists studying mental illness: '
         'The San Diego team used established lab techniques to reprogram '
         'patients’ skin cells into stem cells capable of becoming any other '
         'kind—and then chemically coaxed them into becoming brain cells.\n'
         'This process is now providing the first real stand-ins for brain '
         'cells from mentally ill humans, allowing for unprecedented direct '
         'experiments. Proponents hope studying these lab-grown neurons and '
         'related cells will eventually lead to more precise and effective '
         'treatment options for a variety of conditions. The San Diego team '
         'has already used this technique to show some bipolar cases may have '
         'more to do with protein regulation than genetic errors. And another '
         'lab discovered the activity of glial cells (a type of brain cell '
         'that supports neuron function) likely helps fuel '
         'schizophrenia—upending the theory that the disorder results mainly '
         'from faulty neurons.\n'
         'This new wave of research builds on Shinya Yamanaka’s Nobel-winning '
         'experiments on cellular reprogramming from a decade ago. His '
         'landmark findings about creating induced pluripotent stem cells '
         '(iPSCs) have only recently been applied to studying mental illness '
         'as the field has matured. “What’s really sparked that move now has '
         'been the ability to make patient-specific stem cells—and once you '
         'can do that, then all sorts of diseases become amenable to '
         'investigation,” says Steven Goldman, who specializes in cellular and '
         'gene therapy at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n'
         'To get to the bottom of why lithium helps some bipolar patients, '
         'stem cell scientist Evan Snyder and his colleagues at the Sanford '
         'Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute wanted to examine neuron '
         'formation—comparing samples from those who respond to the medication '
         'and those who do not. The team obtained ordinary skin cells from '
         'people in both groups, and transformed those samples into iPSCs and '
         'then brain cells. “When you reprogram cells into iPSCs they lose all '
         'markers of age, regardless of how old the person is,” says Kristen '
         'Brennand, a stem cell biologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at '
         'Mount Sinai who was not involved in the work. “We can look at '
         'disease risk in a dish without any impact of things like drug abuse '
         'or adolescent trauma or infection of the mother while pregnant—so '
         'all we have is the genetic risk that was there when sperm met egg.”\n'
         'With these lab-grown models, Snyder and his team were able to '
         'compare how neurons matured in the two bipolar groups. They could '
         'also scour the cells’ molecular pathways for possible explanations '
         'about how lithium works, and why. They ultimately found that a '
         'protein called CRMP2, which regulates neural networks and is found '
         'inside of cells, appears to play an outsize role in influencing '
         'whether or not lithium helps patients.\n'
         'Lithium, they concluded, makes CRMP2 act normally. Apparently, the '
         'protein acts sluggishly in some bipolar patients, hampering neurons’ '
         'ability to form dendritic spines—little bumps that occur on the '
         'edges of nerve cells that are necessary for neural communication. '
         'The problem, the researchers found, is not caused by an abnormal '
         'gene or errors in the responsiveness of a gene—or even the amount of '
         'protein a gene makes. Instead, it stems from changes to the shape, '
         'weight or electrical charge of the protein. This makes '
         'lithium-responsive bipolar disease the first confirmed mental health '
         'disorder fueled not by a genetic mutation but rather by hiccups in '
         'the “post-translational modification” of a protein, Snyder says. He '
         'suspects cases of bipolar disorder that do not respond to the drug '
         'actually comprise a different disease altogether.\n'
         'Looking at these findings, researchers may now try to develop '
         'lithium alternatives that similarly restore CRMP2 activity, but only '
         'act on that protein pathway—allowing patients to avoid problematic '
         'side effects that may come from lithium hitting inappropriate '
         'targets. (It can, for example, cause memory deficits and '
         'fine-motor-skill deficiencies.) Researchers have previously had some '
         'information about the brain pathway lithium works on, but Brennand '
         'notes gaps have remained. “Evan has described another target of '
         'lithium, and this one might be more accurate,” she says.\n'
         'One problem in studying mental illness has always been that the '
         'brain is not very accessible while a patient is alive. Scientists '
         'have devised some ways around this: During the last decade '
         'genome-wide association studies have helped scientists link certain '
         'genetic mutations to specific disorders, for example. But that work '
         'left many mysteries about the causes of mental illnesses like '
         'schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder, which are all related to '
         'many genes. Animal studies can often help but scientists cannot know '
         'if a mouse bred to have certain characteristics of schizophrenia is '
         'truly a “schizophrenic mouse.”\n'
         'Work with induced pluripotent stem cells has helped change how '
         'clinicians think about schizophrenia. Goldman and some colleagues '
         'reported in August glial cells play a central role in the disorder. '
         'The researchers took iPSCs from schizophrenic and healthy subjects, '
         'turned them into glial progenitor cells and showed that only the '
         'ones from the mentally ill patients would alter the behavior of mice '
         'implanted with them. These mice developed symptoms similar to those '
         'of some humans with schizophrenia, including reduced inhibition, '
         'social isolation and excessive anxiety.\n'
         'Tapping stem cells is particularly exciting because it can be '
         'coupled with traditional methods of studying mental illness, '
         'according to specialists in the field. For example, once researchers '
         'identify cells they think are significant, they can place them into '
         'mouse models (as Goldman did), seeing how they affect the behavior '
         'of these human–rodent chimeras. “In these cases, we are turning the '
         'mouse brain into a living test tube,” Goldman says. He notes '
         'scientists can also compare cells from a schizophrenic patient and a '
         'mentally healthy patient, and look for anatomical differences. '
         '“These technologies have given us a leg up we didn’t have years '
         'ago,” he adds. Researchers are also coupling iPSCs with gene-editing '
         'techniques to create cell populations with specific genetic '
         'mutations—or to determine whether specific genetic mutations cause '
         'certain problems—says Guo-li Ming, a professor of neuroscience at '
         'the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.\n'
         'Ming was one of the first researchers to employ iPSCs to explore '
         'mental health disorders. Lately she and others have also been taking '
         'the field in another direction: using iPSCs to develop 3-D brain '
         'organoid models, essentially building “mini-brains” comprising '
         'different neural cells. These cells live and interact in a solution, '
         'recapitulating many unique features of human brain development. This '
         'allows scientists to study the cross-talk among different types of '
         'cells in the brain, a process that may be involved in mental health '
         'disorders, Ming says.\n'
         'The tantalizing goals of all of this stem cell work, she says, are '
         'to create personalized medications for individual patients and be '
         'able to quickly screen existing drugs against patients’ cells in the '
         'lab—determining whether doctors should send patients home with '
         'specific drugs. “Maybe in a decade or two we can achieve at least '
         'some of this,” Ming says. Yet already, Snyder says, the new findings '
         'have opened an “entirely new epoch in research.”\n',

 'text': 'Ketamine has been called the biggest thing to happen to psychiatry '
         'in 50 years, due to its uniquely rapid and sustained antidepressant '
         'effects. It improves symptoms in as little as 30 minutes, compared '
         'with weeks or even months for existing antidepressants, and is '
         'effective even for the roughly one third of patients with so-called '
         'treatment-resistant depression\n'
         'Although there are multiple theories, researchers do not quite know '
         'how ketamine combats depression. Now, new research has uncovered a '
         "mechanism that may, in part, explain ketamine's antidepressant "
         'properties. Two studies, recently published in Nature, describe a '
         'distinctive pattern of neural activity that may drive depression in '
         'a region called the lateral habenula (LHb); Ketamine, in turn, '
         'blocks this activity in depression-prone rats.\n'
         'Originally licensed as an anesthetic in 1970, ketamine has since '
         'gained fame as a party drug for causing out-of-body experiences, '
         'hallucinations and other psychosislike effects. Its antidepressant '
         'properties in humans were discovered almost 20 years ago. Ketamine '
         'does not directly influence the same chemical messengers as standard '
         'antidepressants such as serotonin but rather works via interaction '
         'with another chemical, glutamate—not usually associated with mood '
         'but rather with brain plasticity. One prominent idea about how it '
         'alleviates depression is by promoting the growth of new neural '
         'connections. “We provide a new angle for people to think about how '
         'this drug works,” says neuroscientist Hailan Hu of Zhejiang '
         'University in China, leader of the team that conducted both studies. '
         'If she is right, her group may have identified multiple new lines of '
         'attack for treating a condition the World Health Organization calls '
         'the leading cause of disability worldwide.\n'
         'Both new studies probe the workings of the LHb, a small, central '
         "brain region that acts like the dark twin of the brain's reward "
         'centers by processing unexpectedly unpleasant events. For example, '
         'if an animal has been trained to expect food when reaching the end '
         'of a maze and the reward is not there, the LHb activates, signaling '
         'a discrepancy between expectation and outcome. This has led to the '
         'LHb being dubbed the key part of a “disappointment circuit.” If the '
         'LHb is overactive, it could suppress rewards from normally '
         'pleasurable activities—a symptom known as anhedonia—leading to '
         'long-term apathy and hopelessness. Studies in animals suggest '
         'hyperactivity in the LHb contributes to depression, but the details '
         'have been murky.\n'
         'The first study, led by neuroscientist Yan Yang, also at Zhejiang, '
         'discovered a distinctive pattern of rapid bursts in the LHb of rats '
         'that display depressionlike behaviors. More usual neural activity, '
         'where neurons fire at spaced intervals, was not related to '
         'depression, suggesting it is burst activity, rather than increased '
         'LHb activity per se, that is related to depression. Exactly why '
         'bursts are important is not clear, but the researchers think they '
         "may enhance communication with other regions. “It's like a "
         'machine-gun shooting versus single shooting, so it carries '
         'information more efficiently to downstream brain areas,” Hu says. '
         'The team also provoked LHb neurons into burst-firing using '
         'optogenetics, a technology that allows neurons to be activated with '
         'light. The results showed increased depressive behaviors, indicating '
         'the bursts actually cause depression rather than just occur '
         'alongside it.\n'
         'The researchers stumbled on ketamine after they injected a drug that '
         'blocks NMDA receptors (for glutamate that, when activated, allow '
         'calcium to flood inside cells, causing them to fire) in the LHbs of '
         'depression-prone rats and saw strong antidepressant effects. '
         'Ketamine also blocks NMDA receptors, so the team repeated this with '
         'ketamine and again alleviated depression, within one hour. “We show '
         'that infusion of ketamine into just one brain region is sufficient '
         'to cause rapid antidepressant effects,” Hu says. Studies of brain '
         'tissue samples showed that whereas ketamine silenced burst-firing '
         'within minutes, the standard antidepressant fluoxetine HCL, commonly '
         'known as Prozac, had no such effect at these timescales.\n'
         'The second study, led by Zhejiang neuroscientist Yihui Cui, looked '
         'at what might cause burst-firing in depression. The researchers '
         'found a protein, Kir4.1, was present at higher levels in depressive '
         'rats. Kir4.1 is found in cells called astrocytes, which influence '
         'neuronal activity. The team showed this protein promotes '
         'burst-firing in LHb neurons. Raising Kir4.1 levels increased '
         'depressionlike behaviors whereas blocking its function reduced '
         'them.\n'
         'The studies do not reveal how burst-firing influences depression but '
         'the researchers have a hypothesis. The LHb connects to parts of the '
         'limbic system—which processes emotion—as well as reward centers that '
         'signal using chemical messengers associated with pleasure and mood, '
         'like dopamine and serotonin. The LHb inhibits activity in these '
         'regions, so burst-firing may more effectively put the brakes on '
         'systems that produce reward signals from pleasurable activities. '
         '“Our results provide a simple model of how ketamine leads to '
         'disinhibition of the reward center to quickly relieve depression,” '
         'Hu says.\n'
         'Among researchers not taking part in the work, not everyone agrees '
         'the story can be this simple, however. “We’ve found the habenula is '
         'underactive in depressed patients, which is inconsistent with this '
         'data,” says neuroscientist Jonathan Roiser of University College '
         'London. But if these discrepancies can be resolved, studying the LHb '
         'is a promising path toward entirely new approaches to treating '
         'severe depression. “It’s fascinating to see that ketamine dampens '
         'habenular hyperactivity,” says psychiatrist Matthew Klein of the '
         'University of California, San Diego. “Further research will show '
         'whether this is the rapid antidepressant mechanism in human '
         'patients”\n'
         'The new findings have several implications for treatment. '
         'Understanding how ketamine acts so quickly could provide greater '
         'insight into the core mechanisms of depression and help to develop '
         'next-generation ketamine-based treatments that do not have the same '
         'side effects as the drug itself, such as dissociation and bladder '
         'problems. Several pharmaceutical companies have been pursuing this '
         'goal, but knowing what it is about ketamine that produces the '
         'desirable effects could, in principle, aid these efforts.\n'
         'Researchers are still studying ketamine’s long-term effects, safety '
         'and optimum doses in clinical trials. Currently, patients are '
         'administered ketamine via infusions in a hospital that, combined '
         'with the side effects, make it unwieldy. “It would be great if we '
         'could reproduce ketamine’s rapid effects in a simple oral '
         'medication,” Klein says. “Its most exciting benefit is in treating '
         'suicidal ideation, which we currently don’t have any fast-acting '
         'therapies for; it’s an unmet clinical need that could save lives.”\n'
         'The recent work also identifies multiple new targets for therapies, '
         'including Kir4.1 together with another target the work implicated in '
         'burst-firing, called t-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels '
         '(t-VSCCs). The team is next planning to test whether drugs that '
         'block t-VSCCs have antidepressant effects, Hu says.\n',

         "identifying single neurons that would light up in an individual's "
         'brain every time that person saw a particular celebrity—Jennifer '
         'Aniston and Michael Jordan were two examples. As amusing and '
         'remarkable as this finding seemed, even more than a decade later, '

         'in certain brain areas leads to recognition of faces or, most '
         'important, how the brain controls specific behaviors in the human '
         'body.\n'
         'Looking for new ways to study this mystifying organ, researchers are '
         'now turning to computer science algorithms to help them gather data '

         'Researchers started by teaching juvenile damselfish in the '
         "laboratory about the predators they'd encounter, once they settled "
         'on an Australian reef. The training consisted of injecting the '
         "damselfishes' tanks with seawater fouled with both the scent of a "
         'predator, and alarm cues from injured damselfish. A message that, '
         'hey, this predator smell? It means dead friends. Maybe dead you.\n'

                'it be cost-effective?',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'Israel Tests Wireless Charging Roads for Electric Vehicles',
 'text': 'Electric vehicles have long been a promising option for sustainable '
         'transportation. They come with practical headaches like expensive, '
         'bulky batteries that often need recharging, however. Israel is '
         'tackling those hurdles by investing in roads that power electric '
         'buses—as they ride down the street. The government is collaborating '
         'with Israeli start-up ElectRoad to install a public bus route in Tel '
         'Aviv, using an under-the-pavement wireless technology that '
         'eliminates the need for plug-in recharging stations.\n'
         'Although still in its infancy, the technology could clear the three '
         'biggest hurdles—cost, weight and range—that have held back the '
         'widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles for more than a '
         'century. First, though, ElectRoad will have to demonstrate that its '
         '“inductive charging” technology can be scaled up cheaply enough to '
         'be adopted on roadways worldwide. “It’s exciting because it’s '
         'charging without wires,” says Tim Cleary, director of BATTERY, an '
         'energy-storage research laboratory at The Pennsylvania State '
         'University, who is not involved in the project. “But unless it’s '
         'affordable and cost-effective it’s not going to take off.”\n'
         'ElectRoad is betting it will. Wireless charging means the electric '
         'buses can carry a light, inexpensive battery instead of a bulky, '
         'costly one—and never have to stop for recharging. And once a roadway '
         'is outfitted with the technology, it can continuously power properly '
         'equipped vehicles. “You only need to pave for the infrastructure one '
         'time, and that’s it. You can use it for all kinds of vehicles, so '
         'that’s a big advantage,” says Oren Ezer, chief executive and '
         'co-founder of the four-year-old company.\n'
         'So far, the firm’s only proving ground has been an 80-foot test '
         'route at its headquarters in Caesarea. But the technology performed '
         'well enough for the company to win a $120,000 grant from Israel’s '
         'Ministry of Transport and Road Safety and approval to outfit a '
         'portion of a Tel Aviv bus route with their technology, says Shay '
         'Soffer, chief scientist at the ministry. The route will be around '
         'half a mile long and is slated to open in 2018. If all goes well, '
         'the government plans to deploy the technology more widely, starting '
         'with an 11-mile shuttle between the city of Eilat and the Ramon '
         'International Airport. “Tel Aviv is the biggest city [in Israel], '
         'like New York on a small scale. If it will work in Tel Aviv, it will '
         'work anywhere,” Soffer says.“I think in 10 years you’ll see a lot of '
         'solutions like ElectRoad in our transportation.”\n'
         'ElectRoad’s Ezer declined to give the price of the Tel Aviv project '
         'but says the total cost of construction will be shared by the '
         'transport ministry, the city and the company. The cost per kilometer '
         'of roadway will be a crucial factor in future years as the company '
         'attempts to scale up. Israel joins a growing number of nations '
         'exploring the technology. South Korea, for example, already has '
         'several wireless bus routes around the country. The European Union '
         'is studying the feasibility of widespread wireless charging, too. '
         'ElectRoad’s technology is different, Ezer says, because the '
         'transformers are less expensive and the installation process is '
         'faster and more efficient.\n'
         'Inductive charging has been around since the 1890s, when inventor '
         'Nicola Tesla first discovered he could wirelessly power lightbulbs. '
         'Since then it has been used in an array of devices ranging from '
         'phones to toothbrushes—but only recently on the scale of a 13-ton '
         'bus. The buses are charged and propelled by power from the '
         'interaction of two electromagnetic fields. Inverters installed along '
         'the side of the road provide power to plates of copper embedded in '
         'the road. Similar copper plates are installed on the bus’s '
         'underside. As the vehicle passes over the charged roadway, the two '
         'fields interact and generate power.\n'
         'ElectRoad says it can install the technology in an existing road '
         'with minimal disruption, using two tractors that can fully equip one '
         'kilometer of roadway in a single night. Each bus still needs a small '
         'onboard battery for a couple of reasons: The first is to accelerate, '
         'because the jolt of energy required to propel a stationary bus is '
         'far more than the energy it needs to coast down the street. The '
         'second is to provide power on short stretches of road that are not '
         'fitted with the technology. ElectRoad’s buses can travel off the '
         'charging road for about three miles.\n'
         'The biggest advantages of wireless charging are that it allows for '
         'significantly smaller batteries or the ability to travel longer '
         'distances with a larger battery. Both are convenient, says Burak '
         'Ozpineci, who works on wireless technologies at Oak Ridge National '
         'Laboratory in Tennessee. However, the cost of the infrastructure and '
         'materials, especially copper, will likely be expensive, he says. '
         'Currently, the metal costs about $2.60 per pound. In addition to '
         'costing more, wireless power might not be as straightforward as '
         'simply plugging into a socket—the bus could stray from the main '
         'strip, becoming misaligned and delivering less power, according to '
         'Penn State’s Cleary.\n'
         'In addition, the advantages of ElectRoad’s technology may become '
         'less important as electric vehicle batteries get cheaper, lighter '
         'and more efficient. Breakthroughs in engineering and chemistry have '
         'made batteries much more cost-efficient over the past 15 years, says '
         'Dustin Grace, director of battery engineering at Proterra, an '
         'electric bus company. A few years ago a typical electric vehicle '
         'battery cost about $1,000 per kilowatt hour. But now many companies '
         'are down to $200 to $300 per kilowatt hour, and a few, including '
         'Tesla, General Motors and Nissan, are even lower, according to '
         'Grace. “I’m in the camp where I see the cost of lithium ions and '
         'energy storage just plummeting,” Grace says. “What these auto '
         'manufacturers are finding when they’re getting into the '
         '$100-to-$200-per-kilowatt-hour range is these vehicles are really on '
         'parity with other vehicles. They’re no longer looking at batteries '
         'as this challenge that has to be solved.”\n'
         'Ezer acknowledges battery prices are falling but emphasizes '
         'ElectRoad’s solution is not for individual vehicles but for '
         'all-encompassing infrastructure that can eventually serve entire '
         'cities. That’s where the savings are, he says. And remember that '
         'small, light battery onboard? It is only used about 6 percent of the '
         'time the vehicle is running, and thus can last as long as 25 years, '
         'Ezer asserts. By contrast, conventional batteries in electric buses, '
         'like those made by Proterra, last around six years.\n'
         'Despite the challenges of scaling up, ElectRoad is optimistic about '
         'the growing synergies between its vehicles and electric grids that '
         'are transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, '
         'instead of fossil fuels. Eventually, the company even hopes to make '
         'wireless charging a two-way street: not only from road to bus but '
         'vice versa with the energy generated from braking, according to '
         'Ezer.\n'
         'And down the road, the start-up’s dreams are even bigger, Ezer says. '
         '“We plan to start with buses, of course, but we believe in '
         'revolutionizing the entirety of transportation.”\n',

 'text': 'The last male northern white rhinoceros is wallowing in the mud and '
         'grazing again after an age-related infection nearly spelled his end '
         'earlier this month. But although\xa045-year-old Sudan is still '
         'standing—for now—conservationists are debating whether his '
         'subspecies has a chance at survival.\n'
         'There are only three northern white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum '
         'cottoni)\xa0left in the world.\xa0Sudan, the eldest, is the only '
         'male. The other two, Najin and Fatu, are his daughter and '
         'granddaughter, respectively. They all live under armed guard at Ol '
         'Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.\n'
         'None of the rhinos will ever reproduce again naturally. Sudan is too '
         'old, and his sperm quality is dismal, keepers discovered when they '
         'last collected his semen in 2014. Najin is too old to bear the '
         'weight of a mating male or to carry a pregnancy, while Fatu has '
         'uterine problems.\xa0\n'
         'Regarding saving the subspecies, Sudan is already functionally '
         'obsolete, said Jan Stejskal, director of communications and '
         'international projects at Dvr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic, '
         'which technically owns the three rhinos. Najin and Fatu, both of '
         'whom still produce eggs, are the more valuable rhinos for the '
         'future, as their donor eggs could be used in in vitro fertilization '
         'with stored sperm from\xa0a deceased male. The resulting pregnancy '
         'could then be implanted into a\xa0southern white rhinoceros\xa0'
         '(Ceratotherium simum simum), a closely related subspecies. The '
         'question becomes—is saving the northern white rhino worth it?\n'
         'Sudan is cared for around-the-clock by a team of veterinarians and '
         'protected from poachers by armed guards. Caregivers at Ol Pejeta '
         'Conservancy reported on Feb. 28 that a leg infection was threatening '
         'the elderly rhino’s life and that Sudan was responding poorly to '
         'treatment. Over the next week, however, Sudan began to stand, graze '
         'and even wallow in the mud.\n'
         'Still, the last male’s death is likely not far in the future, given '
         'his advanced age. This vision of extinction has spurred debate in '
         'conservation circles, with some arguing that saving the northern '
         'white rhino is a poor use of resources. “[P]revention is better than '
         'cure,” according to\xa0Save the Rhino. The organization argues that '
         'the northern white subspecies is functionally extinct already;\xa0'
         'saving it with IVF and surrogacy\xa0is more akin to\xa0reviving dead '
         'woolly mammoths\xa0than saving a critically endangered subspecies.\n'
         '“Much of the sub-species’ former range has lost rhinos in its '
         'entirety, with limited conservation programmes or expertise for '
         'managing a rhino population, and large-scale habitat loss,” '
         'according to Save the Rhino’s position statement on northern white '
         'rhino IVF. Focusing efforts on poaching prevention—rhino horn is '
         'coveted\xa0for its “medicinal properties," which are just a myth—and '
         'saving habitat would be more beneficial for the other rhino species '
         'that have a better chance at survival, according to the '
         'organization.\n'
         'Stejskal and other researchers active in the IVF project see it '
         'differently. A substantial portion of the donations for saving the '
         'northern white rhino come from parties more interested in the '
         'development of IVF technologies for different species than in rhino '
         'conservation in particular, Stejskal said.\n'
         '“So we actually brought to conservation resources that would be '
         'likely spent on a different subject,” he told Live Science.\n'
         'He also said that knowledge gained through developing IVF for the '
         'northern white rhino could potentially help breeding programs for '
         'other endangered rhino subspecies, particularly the Javan, Sumatran '
         'and black rhinos.\xa0\n'
         'The process of gaining this knowledge is painstakingly slow, '
         'however. In December 2015, experts from around the world met in '
         'Vienna to hash out a plan to save the northern white rhino. In May '
         '2016, the research group published their plan\xa0in the open-access '
         'journal ZooBiology. Their goals included developing a way to collect '
         'eggs from females, a hard-enough task in itself, Stejskal said, '
         'because a rhino’s ovaries are tucked a good 5 feet (1.5 meters) '
         'inside her body, and the egg follicle is a mere millimeter or two in '
         'diameter. Trying to puncture the follicle to collect an egg at such '
         'a distance, with only ultrasound to guide you, is “not really easy,” '
         'Stejskal said.\n'
         'In the nearly two years since the meeting, researchers have made '
         'some progress in egg-harvesting, though, Stejskal said. So far, '
         'they’ve tried it only on southern white rhinoceroses, because '
         'northern white females are too rare to take any risks.\n'
         'Avantea, a veterinary assisted-reproduction company in Cremona, '
         'Italy, has also successfully taken an ovary posthumously from '
         'Nabire,\xa0a northern white rhino who died at Dvr Králové Zoo in '
         '2015, and coaxed eggs out of it that were healthy enough to be '
         'fertilized, Stejskal said. The eggs were old and in bad shape, '
         'Stejskal said, so researchers knew from the start that they would '
         'never be the basis for a viable pregnancy. However, they did nudge '
         'them through the very early stages of embryonic development.\n'
         '“It gave us some initial information on how the rhino embryo '
         'evolves,” Stejskal said.\n'
         'Even if researchers are successful at both creating viable northern '
         'white rhino embryos and getting them to thrive in surrogate mothers, '
         'genetic diversity would be a concern. With just two living sources '
         'of\xa0oocytes\xa0and semen stored from five males, researchers would '
         'have to reboot an entire subspecies from a mere seven animals. '
         'Similar bottlenecks have been overcome before—the 20,000-plus '
         'southern white rhinos alive today descend from around 30 animals '
         'that survived at the end of the 19th century—but the lack of genetic '
         'diversity could cause problems with development or fertility in '
         'potential offspring.\n'
         'That’s why another line of work, spearheaded by\xa0the San Diego Zoo '
         'Institute for Conservation Research, is attempting to turn regular '
         'rhino cells into sperm and egg. Using methods that start with tissue '
         'cells called fibroblasts, researchers can engineer stem cells, which '
         'are cells capable of becoming any kind of body cell. Body tissue has '
         'been banked for an additional five northern white rhinos, Stejskal '
         'said, so stem cell technology could boost the size of the founding '
         'population to 12.\n'
         'While progress is slow, Najin and Fatu are likely to survive and '
         'continue to produce eggs for some time, Stejskal said. As long as '
         'they’re moving forward, the research team is hopeful.\n'
         '“It’s a normal scientific process,” Stejskal said. “If you look at '
         'the history of IVF for people or horses, it was always that it was '
         'many, many trials before it was successful."\n'

 'text': 'The following essay is reprinted with permission from\xa0The '
         'Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\n'
         'Fitness tracking app Strava recently kicked off a privacy and '
         'security storm after it was\xa0revealed\xa0that its software had '
         'potentially exposed the location of secret military bases, courtesy '
         'of a data visualisation tool called a “heatmap”.\n'
         'The\xa0heatmap\xa0was created to depict the activities of Strava '
         'users across the globe. But while it’s a great idea in general (and '
         'quite a nice heatmap), a closer inspection of the user data '
         'generated by the tool highlights some worrying developments.\n'
         'It’s also a reality check for consumers of wearable gadgets—be they '
         'a National Security Agency operative or a retired librarian going '
         'for a gentle jog—who are lax with the privacy and security settings '
         'on apps that monitor location and other personal data.\n'
         'Nathan Ruser, a\xa020-year-old student based in Australia, pored '
         'over Strava’s heatmap and\xa0tweeted\xa0his findings, saying that '
         'the “pretty” data visualisation tool—which mapped 13 trillion GPS '
         'points from the app’s users—wasn’t “amazing for op-sec [operations '
         'security]. US bases are clearly identifiable and mappable.”\n'
         'By publishing the\xa0heatmap of Strava users’ activities\xa0and '
         'their locations, the San Francisco-based company had seemingly '
         'leaked the location of secret bases and routes service personnel use '
         'for exercise.\n'
         'The\xa0Internet of Things (IoT)\xa0represents a new advancement in '
         'technology that harnesses data to help streamline our lives. The '
         'simplest way to think of the IoT is as a network of devices and '
         'objects with embedded electronics—deemed “smart”—that communicate to '
         'perform various tasks.\n'
         'IoT technologies enable voice commands to control appliances such as '
         'lights, TVs and even\xa0door locks. At work,\xa0smart office '
         'buildings\xa0offer significant promise for handling controls such as '
         'energy saving options and may soon become ubiquitous. And, on the '
         'move, wearable technologies such as fitness trackers and smart '
         'watches allow people to track and monitor their exercise regimes.\n'
         'But there are clear security and privacy concerns associated with '
         'using these different forms of new technology. And there’s a danger '
         'that consumers—egged on by digital companies whose income heavily '
         'relies on data sharing—jump too quickly at the convenience of new '
         'personal tech without understanding the risks.\n'
         'In research circles, the risks accompanying IoT technology—including '
         'data leakage via consumer wearables—have been known for some time '
         'now. One of the earliest comprehensive reports on the topic—from '
         'cyber security firm\xa0Symantec\xa0– linked wearables and other '
         'tracking devices to risks including identity theft, profiling and '
         'stalking users.\n'
         'If a criminal accesses someone’s real-time online fitness tracker '
         'data (be it from Strava, FitBit or a smart watch) they could '
         'determine that person’s whereabouts—in and out of work and home. '
         'Oversharing on social media has been\xa0a problem for many years\xa0'
         'as it can lead to crime\xa0online\xa0and in the\xa0physical world.\n'
         'It gets worse. Recently, we conducted\xa0research\xa0on this topic, '
         'to investigate the potential dangers facing users when they share '
         'data from fitness trackers and social media.\n'
         'We found that if a criminal or an organisation were able to combine '
         'data fragments gathered from a tracker and a social media profile, '
         'then users faced significant privacy risks.\n'
         'These include financial loss (home burglary based on the knowledge '
         'of user location and address) and targeted profiling by marketing '
         'companies or even potential employers, who habitually\xa0screen '
         'candidates based on their online profiles.\n'
         'When speaking to users about these risks, we discovered their '
         'general awareness was quite low. The study confirmed other\xa0'
         'research\xa0that we have recently conducted where—to some '
         'users—“privacy is the boring bit” of using smart technologies.\n'
         'The Strava incident, while important, is the\xa0tip of the '
         'iceberg\xa0when it comes to risks associated with the use of '
         'personal IoT technology in the workplace. For instance, an employee '
         'with a malware-infected smart device could then connect it to their '
         'employer’s network.\n'
         'While organisations are largely prepared for this type of risk if it '
         'originates from a personal laptop, it’s a different issue with '
         'wearable devices—which are now being\xa0heavily targeted\xa0by '
         'malware miscreants.\n'
         'The discrete nature of wearables presents another problem: they are '
         'typically paired with a secondary device and are more likely for '
         'that reason to avoid security measures, where checks are only '
         'conducted if a device is directly connected to the corporate '
         'network. Another real problem is that\xa0malicious employees\xa0'
         'seeking to harm their organisation may use IoT technology for '
         'nefarious means, such as stealing intellectual property, or using '
         'hidden devices to inconspicuously record private office '
         'conversations.\n'
         'The Strava episode is a stark reminder that as technology becomes '
         'smarter, it poses significant risks to people’s home, work and '
         'social lives if not properly considered, discussed and addressed. '

 'text': 'On a hot August morning, I stand atop a hill an hour and a half from '
         'Alta Floresta, a small city in central Brazil. Below me is '
         'ranchland, where white cattle graze in the dry season’s relentless '
         'sun. Lines of narrow rivers flanked by thin strips of trees lead, '
         'eventually, to distant forests. Other than where I stand, the '
         'landscape is flat and open, punctuated occasionally by lone '
         'Brazil-nut trees and termite mounds.\n'
         'On one ranch at the valley bottom, just a handful of these mounds '
         'rise up from the ground, 1-meter-tall piles of tan earth. But on a '
         'neighboring property, across a dusty road, the ground is pockmarked '
         'with hundreds of termite towers. Termites normally dig elaborate '
         'tunnels beneath the ground. But when the soil becomes too compacted, '
         'they build above ground instead. “When you see that many termite '
         'mounds,” says Pedro Nogueira, a sustainable ranching expert, “that’s '
         'a clear sign of degraded pasture.”\n'
         'On most of the 24 million hectares (59 million acres) of open '
         'pasture here in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s largest '
         'cattle-producing region, the soil is depleted. The rains have '
         'carried away the nutrient-rich topsoil and eroded the landscape to a '
         'point where the land can support little if any agricultural '
         'activity—including simply growing pasture grass. Yet Nogueira sees '
         'these collapsed landscapes not as a problem but as a solution to '
         'another crisis: the clearing of the Amazon rainforest.\n'
         'Fifty years ago, this region’s topography was hidden from view under '
         'a blanket of thick jungle, teeming with wildlife and water. Then the '
         'settlers came. Poor farmers from southern Brazil were lured here in '
         'the 1970s by the promise of cheap farmland. They first cut and sold '
         'the valuable wood, using chainsaws to fell trees and trucks to carry '
         'them away. After they burned the downed vegetation—releasing huge '
         'quantities of carbon into the atmosphere in the process—they planted '
         'grass and brought in cattle. “This is more or less the classic cycle '
         'of deforestation,” Nogueira says. Mix illegal land-grabbing and land '
         'speculation (a farmable piece of land is valued more highly than '
         'standing forest) with a decade or so of overzealous cattle, corn, '
         'and soy production, and you’ve got a runaway engine that drives 80 '
         'percent of deforestation in the Amazon.\n'
         'This practice of growing cattle on the torched remains of rainforest '
         'is the quickest route to cash-in-hand—if you don’t mind losing money '
         'on skinny cows and poor-quality meat in the long-term. Once the '
         'forest is razed to the ground, the thin layer of nutrients left '
         'behind from a burn is soon lost. Overgrazing and neglect, which are '
         'the norm throughout the Amazon, soon render the soil useless. '
         'Without the money or training to turn it around, ranchers are forced '
         'to abandon the land and find other livelihoods. Other intrepid '
         'settlers, or businessmen with deep pockets, move in and open new '
         'areas of forest to fill the production gap.\n'
         'In southern Brazil, thanks mostly to industrial fertilizers, '
         'centuries-old cattle ranches are now being converted to plantations '
         'of soy, corn, sugar, and eucalyptus. Brazil’s cattle herds are '
         'expanding and moving north into the Amazon region. These local and '
         'regional shifts are also linked to global forces. Worldwide demand '
         'for beef is expected to double by 2050 as the middle class in '
         'developing countries, mostly in Asia and Africa, is able to afford '
         'more protein. Even though only 20 percent of Brazil’s beef is '
         'exported, the country is the second-largest producer of beef in the '
         'world after the U.S. If left unchecked, this increasing demand and '
         'shifting land use will mean more clearing of Brazil’s great tropical '
         'forests.\n'
         'The 2-year-old company Nogueira works for, Pecsa (the Portuguese '
         'acronym for Sustainable Cattle Ranching in the Amazon), and its '
         'myriad partners have another idea. They believe that there is '
         'already enough open land in Brazil to meet the rising demand for '
         'beef, soy, and corn well into the future without cutting one more '
         'tree. Pecsa is a B-corp (a certified environmentally and socially '

         'efficient businesses that are also sustainable.\n'
         'As the sun blazed in the sky, Nogueira and I watch cool water, '
         'pumped from a river below, flow into a holding pond on the hilltop. '
         'We wander down the slope—to the ranch where just a few termite '
         'mounds protrude—following the path of buried irrigation pipes to '
         'their outlet at a group of watering troughs. Jose Enrique “Neno” da '
         'Silva, the main ranch hand, approaches on horseback. He and his '
         'assistant wear jeans, wide-brimmed woven hats unique to Mato Grosso '
         'cowboys, and long-sleeve shirts printed with the Pecsa logo. They '
         'drive a herd of cattle into an “area de lazier,” or leisure area, a '
         'shaded feeding and watering ground. Each leisure area is surrounded '
         'by three to six grazing parcels, and da Silva is responsible for '
         'moving the herds from lot to lot on a schedule cued by the height of '
         'the grass. On the traditional ranches where da Silva previously '
         'worked, cattle were spread out on large tracts of land and even '
         'allowed to graze in the forest reserves.\n'
         'As basic as the Pecsa system sounds—fences, watering and feeding '
         'troughs, and rotational grazing—what’s happening on the ranches the '
         'company manages is at the heart of a larger strategy to end cattle '
         'ranching’s role in degrading and destroying Amazon ecosystems.\n'
         'Western-wear clothing boutiques, feed stores, açai ice cream shops, '
         'and showrooms filled with shiny new farm tractors line the streets '
         'of downtown Alta Floresta, a city of 50,000 people at the southern '
         'edge of the Amazon basin. The streets here are laid out neatly in a '
         'grid, with middle-class houses on small yards next to neighborhood '
         'grocery stores. It’s less like the haphazard chaos of cities and '
         'towns elsewhere in the region and more like, well, Kansas, with a '
         'touch of Texas. While ranching itself has not been profitable for '
         'most who have tried it, the industry that grew up around it and the '
         'agribusiness that followed have laid a solid foundation for the '
         'economy here, and it shows.\n'
         'Pecsa’s office sits on a corner of the main street beneath tall '
         'shade trees. Behind the shiny silver company sign out front, the '
         'office is bustling with young employees when I visit, all wearing '
         'Pecsa’s blue button-down shirts, baseball caps, and work boots. They '
         'are the sons and daughters of ranchers, agriculturalists, '
         'journalists, MBAs, and environmentalists—the majority of whom grew '
         'up in the region. \xa0\n'
         'Vando Telles, Pecsa’s CEO, sits behind an uncluttered desk in an '
         'office that smells faintly of fresh paint. “This story has a '
         'personal side,” he begins. Telles grew up on a small ranch outside '
         'of town. He was born in Alta Floresta a few years after his dad '
         'arrived in 1976 as one of the first settlers, before the town was '
         'incorporated. “There was a lot of forest here and nothing else,” '
         'Telles says. “Only the little dirt roads that opened the area in the '
         'beginning.”\n'
         'Telles’s father, along with thousands of other settlers, bought land '
         'from a man named Ariosto da Riva. Riva was known as “the last of the '
         'bandeirantes,” a controversial and often brutal band of men who '
         'opened the Amazon in search of gold with the help of the country’s '
         'then-military dictatorship. Riva bought more than a million acres '
         'from the government for the cost of a few head of cattle. As '
         'settlers and would-be ranchers followed the gold rush into the '
         'region, Riva set up a small office downtown and sold off parcels to '
         'the migrants. Thus began the decline of the region’s forests.\n'
         'A complex set of environmental laws originating in 1965 '
         'theoretically protects Brazil’s forests. The Forest Code requires '
         'landowners in the Amazon to retain 50 to 80 percent of their land in '
         'native vegetation; the percentage varies depending on lot size and '
         'timing of purchase. Clearing more than that was and still is '
         'considered illegal deforestation.\n'
         'In the decades since, though, enforcement has come and gone with '
         'political will. For years, the government also encouraged settlers '
         'to clear forest along rivers, to ward off malaria and yellow fever. '
         'The challenge of enforcing the laws across more than 500 million '
         'hectares (2 million square miles) of thick and often impassable '
         'jungle, the conflicting agendas of various government ministries, '
         'and shifting political fortunes have all left the authority of the '
         'Forest Code severely hampered.\n'
         'Residents in isolated counties like Alta Floresta continued cutting '
         'forest without penalty well into the 2000s. Local and federal '
         'enforcement was (and often still is) practically non-existent in '
         'secluded corners of the Amazon. Plus, the incentives to clear forest '
         'were powerful. “When you turn a forested area into pasture, the '
         'value of the land can go up by 1,000 percent or more, because now '
         'you can run an economic activity there,” says Carlos Saviani, a '
         'former Brazilian cattle rancher who is now vice-president of '
         'sustainable food programs for the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. (WWF).\n'
         'For most of modern history, Brazilians along with the rest of the '
         'world, thought that standing forests were worthless and the Amazon '
         'limitless. Today, of course, we know better. Tropical forests are '
         'not only invaluable, species-rich ecosystems, but they play an '
         'essential role in regulating the planet’s climate. Without them, we '
         'board the bullet train to a warmer climate. Replace the trees with '
         'cattle, the second largest global emitter of the greenhouse gas '
         'methane, and now we’re on a rocket ship. So in the ’80s and ’90s, '
         'environmental groups started getting serious about protecting the '
         'Amazon—and calling out the beef industry for its role in '
         'deforestation.\n'
         'In Alta Floresta at the time, tensions ran high between '
         'environmentalists and cattle ranchers. Environmentalists blamed '
         'ranchers for the loss of the forests. Ranchers argued that they '
         'lacked the resources to maintain or improve their farms, let alone '
         'to preserve forests. Telles lived that story as he was growing up. '
         'He watched his father work hard and struggle to make a profit, '
         'ultimately selling off cattle and land just to stay afloat. “The '
         'farms were always in a state of decline,” Telles says.\n'
         'And the conflict only grew. On the international scene, NGOs such as '
         'the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), WWF, and Greenpeace brought '
         'mainstream media attention to the damage cattle ranching was causing '
         'in the Amazon. They put a spotlight on international companies that '
         'were buying beef from Amazon slaughterhouses. “These companies '
         'started to get a lot of pressure, not only from civil society and '
         'their consumers, but also from investors,” Saviani says. By the late '
         '’90s, companies acquiesced, signing commitments to “zero '
         'deforestation.” The details of those commitments vary, but in '
         'general, “retailers are pledging to ensure that their products will '
         'not contain raw materials or ingredients produced on land that was '
         'recently cleared,” says Simon Hall, NWF’s manager for tropical '
         'forests and agriculture. McDonald’s and several other retailers '
         'stopped buying beef from the Amazon altogether.\n'
         'That pressure worked its way down the supply chain, too. Under '
         'global scrutiny, a new Brazilian government found the political will '
         'to begin protecting forests. In 2007, they launched a campaign '
         'called the “Arc of Fire” and started cracking down on illegal '
         'deforestation. New satellite technology greatly improved their '
         'ability to pinpoint areas of recent logging. The government made a '
         'list of the 36 municipalities responsible for half of all the '
         'deforestation in the Amazon. Alta Floresta was one of them. By the '
         'time it ended up on that blacklist, Alta Floresta had already lost '
         'about half of its forests.\n'
         'Shortly after the blacklist was published, and in a dramatic display '
         'of power, Brazil’s environmental enforcement agency sent thousands '
         'of cars, trucks, and helicopters to Alta Floresta. Over several '
         'years, they raided farms, ranches, and timber operations, seized '
         'equipment, froze assets, and began making arrests and issuing '
         'fines.\n'
         'In 2009, Brazil’s three largest slaughterhouses agreed to stop '
         'buying cattle from producers that had cleared forest illegally. They '
         'also pledged to start monitoring their suppliers. Alta Floresta’s '
         'producers were embargoed from selling their cattle to the major '
         'slaughterhouses and other buyers. They were also denied access to '
         'rural credit, on which many of the region’s small producers depended '
         'to make ends meet.\n'
         'To reactivate the economic activities of the town, landowners had to '
         'register their land, declare the extent of deforestation, and '
         'develop a plan to restore those areas within 10 years. “We were seen '
         'by the entire country as bad people. From that point, everybody '
         'realized we had to take action,” Alta Floresta’s then-mayor told a '
         'researcher from Princeton University.\n'
         'The mayor engaged the non-profit Instituto Centro de Vida (ICV), '
         'which had been working on reforestation and other efforts in the '
         'region for years. The institute’s experts realized that to combat '
         'deforestation, they had to address the reasons cattle ranches were '
         'failing in the first place. “We never wanted to work with livestock, '
         'but we needed to in order to find a solution for this problem,” says '
         'Francisco Beduschi Neto, now the director of ICV’s sustainable '
         'ranching program. Rather than trying to fight cattle ranching, they '
         'decided to work with it. Environmentalists and ranchers began to '
         'find a common path forward.\n'
         'In 2010, ICV hired Telles to launch a pilot project called “Novo '
         'Campo” with 10 partner ranches. They built a program that included '
         'replanting pasture with hardier grasses to improve the soil and '
         'recover degraded land, practicing rotational grazing to improve '
         'productivity, and training ranch staff and hiring management '
         'consultants to increase profits. “We didn’t do anything that was '
         'magical,” Telles says. “We got knowledge, resources, and applied it '
         'in the right way.” The results were impressive. Ranches were soon '
         'raising triple the amount of cattle on the same amount of land, and '
         'turning a healthy profit.\n'
         'Considering the region’s past tendencies to ignore environmental '
         'laws, ICV’s leaders knew that monitoring would be important, so they '
         'created systems to ensure that no cattle in their supply chain would '
         'come from ranches with deforestation after 2008 (the cutoff date set '
         'in the Forest Code). Their partner ranches were also required to '
         'commit to zero deforestation and begin replanting riparian areas and '
         'forest reserves to meet Forest Code requirements.\n'
         'The program’s early successes won international attention. In July '
         '2015, with a multi-million-dollar investment from a capital fund, '
         'Telles and several other staff moved from ICV to create the '
         'for-profit company Pecsa. They expanded the program from about 400 '
         'to 10,000 hectares (from 988 to 24,700 acres) on medium- and '
         'large-size ranches, including the farm I visited with Nogueira.\n'
         'In 2013, a group of producers, slaughterhouses, retailers, and NGOs '
         'formed the Global Roundtable on Sustainable Beef, which combines '
         'voluntary commitments from businesses with monitoring by NGOs. It’s '
         'a big shift from the earlier, adversarial days. In the beginning, '
         'reputational risk was the main motivation for companies to sign '
         'zero-deforestation commitments. But today, those companies are '
         'realizing that climate change poses a serious risk to their supply '
         'chain as well.\n'
         'When I stop by Pecsa’s offices, Telles is preparing for a visit from '
         'McDonald’s independent auditors. Last year, with the help of the '
         'Roundtable, Pecsa signed its first contract to supply McDonald’s '
         'restaurants in Rio de Janeiro, ending the fast-food giant’s 37-year '
         'moratorium on buying beef from the Amazon.\n'
         '“It’s an important partnership,” Telles says.\n'
         'Beduschi agrees: “When McDonald’s acts, a lot of people pay '
         'attention.”\n'
         'I return to the Pecsa ranch early one morning to spend the day with '
         'da Silva, the ranch manager, and his crew. We sit at a long handmade '
         'table in da Silva’s open-air kitchen, with his wife, Maria, and '
         'their three daughters. Maria serves coffee in glass jars and we '
         'snack on farm cheese as we talk about life on the ranch. “Here we '
         'have more value than on other ranches,” da Silva says. “With the '
         'other farmers, you don’t have a time schedule, or weekends, or '
         'holidays, you just have to work.” In contrast, part of Pecsa’s '
         'agenda is to conform to Brazil’s labor laws. This is a unique policy '
         'in an industry that still exploits slave labor in remote areas.\n'
         'A warm wind blows through the kitchen. “The weather has changed a '
         'lot,” da Silva says. “The rain takes a lot longer to arrive. But it '
         'won’t be long now.” He turns towards the distant clouds. “O ar é de '
         'chuva,” he says, which in Portuguese means, “this wind is of rain.”\n'
         'Loading the feed tractor out on the ranch, da Silva runs his hand '
         'over dried bunch grass, an African variety selected and planted here '
         'by Pecsa. “When the rain comes, this grass will green up. Then the '
         'cattle really fatten up and build muscle mass,” he says.\n'
         'Midwestern Brazil is in the middle of a serious drought. It has been '
         'two months without a drop of rain in Alta Floresta, slowing the '
         'growth of the soy and corn crops, which Pecsa relies on for '
         'supplemental feed. By using this feed during the dry season and the '
         'last couple months of the cows’ lives, Pecsa manages to get the '
         'animals to slaughter-weight a year earlier than on conventional '
         'ranches. That means the cattle emit at least 25 percent less methane '
         'than animals fed solely on pasture grasses.\n'
         'While Pecsa’s intensification strategy increases the number of '
         'cattle on the land, it also reduces the amount of methane emitted '
         'per kilo of beef produced. According to a study conducted by an '
         'independent Brazilian research organization, all of the reforms on a '
         'Pecsa ranch taken together result in 90 percent fewer greenhouse gas '
         'emissions per kilo of beef than a conventional ranch in the same '
         'region.\n'
         'Supplemental feeding, though, requires growing grain. That has '
         'raised concerns that changing from pasture-only to '
         'supplementary-feed practices will push demand for farmland into the '
         'forests once again.\n'
         'But, says Laurent Micol, co-founder of Pecsa, raising more cattle in '
         'less space can free up land for grain production or conservation.\n'
         'Biologists debate whether intensive or extensive—low-yield '
         'production over large areas—agriculture, is the best way to feed the '
         'world and save biodiversity. Some argue that sparing land through '
         'intensification elsewhere is most beneficial to biodiversity in the '
         'tropics. In frontier areas like Alta Floresta, agriculture pushes '
         'into previously undisturbed forest habitat, and habitat loss is the '
         'biggest cause of species decline. Intensification theoretically '
         'allows large tracts of intact ecosystems to be set aside as '
         'protected areas, in line with the letter of Brazil’s Forest Code. '
         'The challenge now is to get the on-the-ground reality to match the '
         'laws on paper.\n'
         'On my last afternoon on the ranch, Nogueira and I cross a plank '
         'bridge and drop down to a creek. He points out chest-high trees '
         'growing in rows parallel to the water. Pecsa buys hardy species that '
         'do well in degraded land from a local nursery—mostly legumes, which '
         'fix nitrogen and improve the soil. They plant them along waterways '
         'that have been stripped of their forest on all six of the ranches '
         'they manage. Nogueira stands near a 1.2-meter (4-foot) Samauma tree '
         '(Ceiba samauma). “If all goes well, this will eventually grow to be '
         'the tallest tree in the forest,” he says.\n'
         'Three blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna) squawk as they fly over '
         'the canopy of the farm’s forest reserve a few hundred yards away. '
         'Earlier that week, da Silva had seen jaguar (Panthera onca) tracks '
         'crossing the farm. “We’re starting to see lots of animals here,” he '
         'tells me. Fat three-toed tracks of a tapir (Tapirus terrestris) lead '
         'through the dried mud up to the water’s edge. Tapirs are the largest '
         'herbivorous mammal in South American forests, and normally, an '
         'elusive species that avoids human disturbance. In otherwise broken '
         'landscapes, wildlife will use forests along waterways as corridors '
         'to move between patches of forest. This one, still in its infancy, '
         'already seems to be doing its job. \xa0\n'
         'We walk along the road through the ranch’s legal forest reserve. '
         'Tall trees tower overhead and thick undergrowth darkens the forest, '
         'obscuring the view beyond a few feet. The low afternoon light '
         'streaks through the trees and sets the dust above the road aglow. It '
         'is several degrees cooler and more humid under the forest canopy '
         'than out in the pasture. “That’s from the forest breathing,” says '
         'Denise Farias, Pecsa’s communications director, who is along for the '
         'walk.\n'
         'While that sounds poetic, it is also a scientific fact. New research '
         'is showing how trees in tropical forests help to generate clouds and '
         'regulate precipitation, not just locally but around the globe. It '
         'also points to the impact that continued large-scale forest loss '
         'would have on surface temperature, the prevalence of fire, and the '
         'duration of droughts. It’s not a pleasant picture.\n'
         'I ask Nogueira if he thinks Pecsa’s strategy for transforming the '
         'cattle industry will stop deforestation of the Amazon. “It’s one '
         'essential tool in the toolbox,” he says. “But it must be linked to '
         'enforcement and other strategies.”\n'
         'Pecsa is now poised to scale up its project to 100,000 hectares '
         '(247,105 acres) over the next six years. The demand for resources to '
         'transform ranching throughout the Amazon is gigantic. The cost to '
         'remodel farms and reforest waterways is about $1,100 per hectare. In '
         'northern Mato Grosso alone, there are 4.5 million hectares (11 '
         'million acres) of pasture. “It’s a big transition,” Micol says. “It '
         'is not going to happen in three or five years. It is going to take a '
         'decade or more to make this transition widespread.”\n'
         'As I leave the ranch, the sun is setting in brilliant shades of '
         'orange and pink. A rainbow from the first rains of the wet season '
         'hangs just above a patch of forest in the distance. Alta Floresta '
         'may never return to the wild jungles that once covered it, but one '
         'day it might approximate something close, even with the cattle '
         '“Bringing back the forest is complex,” Beduschi says, “but not '
         'impossible.”\n'

         'business-as-usual scenario.\n'
         'Researchers at the Institute for Transportation and Development '
         'Policy and the University of California, Davis, modeled how each new '
         'development might change carbon emissions around the world.\n'
         '“It’s becoming increasingly clear that all three of these possible '
         'revolutions are reaching maturity,” said Lewis Fulton, a co-director '
         'at the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis and lead '
         'author of the report. “It’s time for all of us, whether we’re '
         'researchers or policymakers or the general public, to think more '
         'deeply about where these things seem to be going. In 10 years, it '
         'may be too late to change the trajectory. It’s the time now to '
         'figure out which trajectory is the best.”\n'
         'While some transportation researchers have suggested autonomous cars '
         'could cut emissions by boosting driver efficiency, others, including '
         'Fulton and his colleagues, project that energy use and carbon '
         'emissions would increase over a business-as-usual scenario because '
         'more people will travel farther.\n'
         'Emissions reduction comes only when the vehicles are electrified and '
         'plugging into an increasingly cleaner grid.\n'
         '“We have to stop thinking that self-driving cars will automatically '
         'be sustainable,” Fulton said. “We need policies to make sure we '
         'steer this towards electric and efficient.”\n'
         'The most advanced scenario in the report requires people to change '
         'their behavior, using substantially more ride sharing, public '
         'transport, cycling and walking. That would cut car travel by more '
         'than half in 2050, and the number of cars by nearly three-quarters.\n'
         'Worldwide, that combination would generate 0.7 gigaton of carbon '
         'emissions annually by midcentury, as opposed to 1.7 gigatons in the '
         'second one and 4.6 gigatons in a business-as-usual scenario.\n'
         'In the United States, transportation has surpassed the electricity '
         'sector as the top source of greenhouse gas emissions, at around 30 '
         'percent. The most utopian scenario could cut that by nearly 90 '
         'percent in 2050, or the equivalent to shutting down 172 coal-fired '
         'power plants in a year.\n'
         'The changes could cut the cost of buying, fueling and operating the '
         'cars by more than 40 percent.\n'
         'Fulton also recognized that upending the transportation sector would '
         'require overcoming the attachment many people have to their '
         'individual cars, saying that government would have to play a “major '
         'role.”\n'
         'Incorporating more ride sharing and public transit was the only '
         'scenario that matched with a pathway to keep global warming under 2 '
         'degrees Celsius.\n'

                'effective',
 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'How Fake Surgery Exposes Useless Treatments',
 'text': 'Two weeks after my husband had a couple of stents installed in his '
         'coronary arteries, he awoke to this headline in the New York Times: '
         '“‘Unbelievable’: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain.” He was '
         'incredulous. For weeks before his surgery, he had felt stabbing '
         'pains in his chest any time he exerted himself. Now he felt '
         'fantastic and was back to playing his beloved Ultimate Frisbee.\n'
         'The headline reflected the results of a British study, published '
         'online last November in the Lancet, that used what is probably the '
         'best methodology for assessing a surgical procedure: sham surgery. '
         'In this case, 200 patients with a blocked artery were randomly '
         'assigned to get either a real stent operation or a fake one. In the '
         'real version, a surgeon snaked a balloon-tipped catheter through an '
         'artery in the groin or arm up to the blockage, widened the vessel by '
         'inflating the balloon, and then kept it open with a tubelike stent '
         'made of wire mesh. In the sham procedure, a catheter was directed to '
         'the blockage, but the surgeon only pretended to do the rest. The '
         'astonishing finding: there was no difference in how the patients '
         'felt six weeks after surgery. Both groups reported less pain, and '
         'both performed better on treadmill tests.\n'
         'Stent operations, or angioplasties, are wildly popular. At least '
         'half a million are done annually around the world. There is little '
         'question they are great for people in the throes of a heart attack '
         'but serious debate over their merits for other patients. Multiple '
         'studies have shown that they do not lower the risk of heart attacks '
         'or death. The main justification has been to relieve symptoms such '
         'as chest pain, known as stable angina, and shortness of breath. The '
         'British study has now undercut that idea. Giving drugs to control '
         'cardiovascular disease, as was done for all 200 patients in the '
         'study, along with lifestyle changes, appears to be the way to go for '
         'most people.\n'
         'How did an operation that now seems to have a rather limited '
         'application become such a blockbuster? You might ask the same '
         'question about many other procedures. Take arthroscopic knee '
         'surgery, the number-one most common orthopedic operation. More than '
         'two million are done annually to tidy up ragged cartilage in people '
         'with arthritis and degenerative wear and tear in their knees, '
         'including a torn meniscus. Yet sham surgery studies and other '
         'research have shown it offers no advantages for the vast majority of '
         'such patients. They would do just as well with physical therapy, '
         'weight loss and exercise.\n'
         'Consider this: before a new drug is approved for marketing, '
         'researchers must show that it is more effective than a sugar pill. '
         'Not so for a new operation. And yet surgeries have a much bigger '
         'placebo effect than drugs. To quantify the difference, a 2013 '
         'meta-analysis looked at placebo effects in 79 studies of migraine '
         'prevention: sugar pills reduced headache frequency for 22 percent of '
         'patients, fake acupuncture helped 38 percent, and sham surgery was a '
         "hit for a remarkable 58 percent. “There's a big placebo effect with "
         'any procedure,” says cardiologist Rita Redberg of the University of '
         'California, San Francisco.\n'
         'And yet sham surgery studies are rarely done, especially in the '
         'U.S., where ethics boards resist subjecting patients to incisions, '
         'anesthesia and other risks without delivering an actual treatment. '
         'Redberg, who has written about the value of these studies, takes the '
         "opposite view: “I think it's unethical not to do them.” Otherwise "
         'you may be exposing millions of people to the risks and the '
         'financial costs of surgery for a placebo effect that will not likely '
         'last.\n'
         'Sham-controlled studies have spared us some useless operations. '
         'Vertebroplasty—injecting bone cement to mend a fractured '
         'vertebra—was gaining credence in the early 2000s until a 2009 sham '
         'study showed it was no better than a placebo. Since then, its '
         'popularity has dropped by about 50 percent, according to David S. '
         'Jevsevar, chair of orthopedics at the Geisel School of Medicine at '
         'Dartmouth. His research also shows a 28 percent decline in people '
         'with arthritis getting arthroscopic meniscus surgery.\n'
         "But changing doctors' behavior is tough. They tend to think that "
         "“‘this is what we've been trained to do and we get good results, so "
         'we should keep on doing it,’” Jevsevar observes.\n'
         'Stent surgery will most likely remain unreasonably popular for a '
         'long while. My advice if someone close to you is about to get it is '
         "to ask questions, lots of questions, beginning with: Wouldn't drugs, "
         'diet and exercise do the trick?\n',

 'name': "Russia's New Nukes Are Similar to a Risky Project the U.S. Abandoned",
 'text': 'Part of Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin’s state of the nation speech '
         'Thursday sounded like something from a 1960s James Bond film. Putin '
         'announced his country has developed and recently tested a cruise '
         'missile and an underwater drone that are nuclear-powered as well as '
         'hypersonic missiles capable of flying at up to 20 times the speed of '
         'sound. Putin’s words were punctuated by video and computer graphics '
         'the Russian leader used to drive home the point that the weapons '
         'would render NATO’s U.S.-led missile defense systems “useless.”\n'
         'For the West, the prospect of Russia having all three of those new '
         'weapons is unsettling to say the least. But the nuclear-powered '
         'cruise missile, in particular, harkens back to a weapons system the '
         'U.S. Air Force began developing at the height of the cold war and '
         'later abandoned. Project Pluto (pdf), an initiative commissioned in '
         '1957, had the goal of developing nuclear-powered engines for use in '
         'Supersonic Low-Altitude Missiles (SLAM). The Pentagon tested '
         'prototype engines with 500-megawatt reactors at the Department of '
         'Energy Nevada Test Site in 1961 and 1964, but soon after had second '
         'thoughts about the project.\n'
         'Scientific American spoke with Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist in '
         'the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Global Security Program, about '
         'the eerie parallels between Putin’s nuclear-powered missile and '
         'Project Pluto—including the Pentagon’s reasons for ending the '
         'project, and the lessons about the dangers of nuclear power and '
         'weaponry that seem to have been forgotten.\n'
         '[An edited transcript of the conversation follows.]\n'
         'In what ways does Putin’s nuclear-powered cruise missile appear '
         'similar to Project Pluto?\n'
         'Project Pluto was going to use a ramjet engine to draw in air at a '
         'supersonic speed, use a nuclear reactor to heat the air to get it to '
         'expand, and then use that expanded air to generate thrust. So the '
         'U.S. did contemplate a similar idea, the advantage being the use of '
         'long-lived nuclear fuel to keep the missile airborne for a long '
         'time, evade defenses, maneuver extensively and reach its target with '
         'a high level of accuracy.\n'
         'Would the U.S. missile’s nuclear fuel also be part of its payload '
         'when striking its target?\n'
         'Based on the plan for the U.S. program, the missile itself—even '
         'before reaching its target—would be a flying death factory [in '
         'addition to any nuclear payload that might be attached to the '
         'projectile]. The reactor would presumably not have any lead or '
         'concrete radiation shielding, because that would have made the '
         'missile too heavy. Such an unshielded missile would have generated a '
         'very intense flux of neutrons, so simply being in close proximity to '
         'it would have been lethal. The missile would have drawn air from the '
         'outside, heated it to a very high temperature with direct contact '
         'with nuclear fuel and then expelled the air. So fission products and '
         'radioactive particles would continuously be expelled into the '
         'environment.\n'
         'How close was the U.S. Air Force to developing a working '
         'nuclear-powered missile?\n'
         'They had a proof-of-principle reactor on the ground, but my '
         'impression is that at the time the project was canceled there was '
         'probably still a substantial amount of engineering work that needed '
         'to be done, not to mention flight testing. Amazingly, the prospect '
         'of testing this monster —even during the height of the cold war—was '
         'too horrific for the Air Force, which tells you something about the '
         'weapon they had in mind.\n'
         'Was the Air Force concerned about the missile detonating during '
         'testing?\n'
         'No, there were concerns about the hazards of operating this reactor '
         'in the first place. A brochure put out by the Nevada National '
         'Security Site [in 2013] points out that Pluto would “deafen, flatten '
         'and irradiate people along its flight path.” Clearly, in that era '
         'the Atomic Energy Commission and the Pentagon had shown themselves '
         'not to be overly concerned about civilian safety—they were still '
         'doing atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons—so their standards were '
         'pretty low for protecting the public. The fact that Pluto was too '
         'troubling even for them is a worrisome sign, given that Russia seems '
         'to have gone ahead with a similar project.\n'
         'How long would it have taken Russia to create the weapon Putin '
         'described, assuming it is similar to the Project Pluto missile?\n'
         'This may have been in response to the general deterioration of '
         'relations between the U.S. and Russia over the past decade and a '
         'half, dating back to the George W. Bush administration’s withdrawal '
         'from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002. The U.S. and NATO’s '
         'continued development of ballistic missile defense has clearly been '
         'a concern for Russia, even though the U.S. and NATO have insisted '
         'those systems are intended for use against rogue states like Iran '
         'and North Korea rather than Russia. [Other steps in that direction '
         'were] the U.S. continuing to pursue a relatively strong posture in '
         'its deterrence strategy as well as the [2018] Nuclear Posture Review '
         'released by the Trump administration. Russia must have been working '
         'on this for some time if they have a successful system.\n'
         'How likely is it that Russia has, in fact, developed the system that '
         'Putin described?\n'
         'I can’t really say. I would note there was a Washington Post story '
         'today, citing Fox News, that says the Pentagon was aware of a '
         'Russian test of a nuclear-powered cruise missile—but the system was '
         'still under development and had recently crashed in the Arctic. You '
         'would think that a flight test of this type of weapon system '
         'couldn’t be concealed—so, someone knows. All I can say is that if '
         'it’s real, it’s a development of great concern and would show a '
         'level of recklessness in Russian decision-making that even the U.S. '
         'wasn’t going to engage in during the cold war.\n'
         'Are the lessons learned decades ago about the devastation of nuclear '
         'weapons being ignored?\n'
         'One had hoped that the 1950s dream of using nuclear energy to power '
         'everything had been put to bed. Putin’s new weapons and NASA’s talk '
         'of using nuclear reactors to power spacecraft suggest some of those '
         'dreams are being revisited. This Pandora’s box does seem to have '
         'been opened again on both sides, and all of the old objections as to '
         'why you would not want to put nuclear reactors on high-speed '
         'vehicles that you’d launch into space still apply. There seems to be '
         'a collective amnesia—policy makers and the public have to relearn '
         'lessons learned a long time ago.\n',

         'investors\xa0expected Spark to charge $1 million\xa0or more for '
         'Luxturna, so the actual price will be considered a bargain by some.\n'
         '“I feel like we made the right middle ground decision,” Marrazzo '
         'said in an interview, balancing the company’s desire to capture the '
         'economic value of Luxturna while ensuring patients will have access '
         'to the therapy.\n'
         'To further smooth reimbursement—and mute the inevitable criticism '
         'about the price—Spark on Wednesday announced a commitment to offer '
         'rebates to health insurers if patients fail to meet specified vision '
         'thresholds 30-90 days and 30 months following Luxturna treatment. '
         'One-time gene therapies are meant to be curative, but patients in '
         'clinical trials have not been followed long enough to determine if '
         'treatment benefits are durable for decades.\n'
         'Spark reached an agreement in principle with nonprofit health plan '
         'Harvard Pilgrim, which insures 1.2 million people across New '
         'England, for the first outcomes-based rebate arrangement. Additional '
         'rebate contracts with other commercial insurance companies are being '
         'negotiated, Spark said.\n'
         'How much of the $850,000 cost of Luxturna would be returned to '
         'insurers if patients don’t benefit from treatment was not '
         'disclosed.\n'
         'Harvard Pilgrim and Express Scripts, the country’s largest pharmacy '
         'benefits manager, have also agreed to a new contracting arrangement '
         'with Spark that guarantees patient access to Luxturna in exchange '
         'for reducing the financial burden and risk for treatment providers '
         'and insurers.\n'
         'Under another proposal still in the conceptual stage, Spark would '
         'allow insurers to spread the payments for Luxturna over multiple '
         'years.\n'

         'it’s all pretty much in line with what we’re seeing in other '
         'innovative therapies,” said Dr. Stuart Orkin, a pediatric oncologist '
         'at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital. '
         'He cited CAR-T therapies for cancer, which cost hundreds of '
         'thousands of dollars, and newfangled immuno-oncology treatments with '
         'similar price tags.\n'
         'The question for Orkin, who has written extensively about how '
         'society should pay for gene therapy, will be just how Spark '
         'determines whether an individual patient treated with Luxturna has '
         '“failed” and thus merits a rebate.\n'
         '“But I do applaud them for thinking through the payment schemes,” '
         'Orkin said. “It’s better than if they had just put out a price and '
         'said, you know, ‘You’re paying it.”\n'
         'The Food and Drug Administration approved Luxturna in December to '
         'treat people with a type of inherited retinal disease caused by a '
         'mutation in a gene called RPE65. People born with mutated RPE65 '
         'genes suffer from severe vision problems, including night blindness. '
         'As the disease progresses, people lose all functional vision and can '
         'eventually become totally blind.\n'
         'The condition is rare, affecting between 1,000 and 2,000 people in '
         'the U.S. About 10-20 babies are born each year with RPE65-mutated '
         'retinal disease, Spark estimates.\n'
         'Wall Street analysts, on average, are forecasting Luxturna sales to '
         'reach $364 million by 2022, according to Evaluate. By drug industry '
         'standards, which anoint blockbuster status to products that generate '

         'Trump without a science adviser as the administration wrestles with '
         'a severe outbreak of the flu, lead-poisoned drinking water and '
         'record-breaking disasters that many scientists say are sharpened by '
         'rising temperatures.\n'
         "More than a year into his term, Trump hasn't identified a potential "
         'nominee for the key position held by prominent scientists in '
         'Republican and Democratic administrations alike. And it stands to '
         "get harder. There's a razor-thin margin for Senate approval, and "
         "Trump's critics and supporters could complicate the confirmation of "
         'anyone who rejects mainstream climate science.\n'
         'That means the job falls to Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant '
         'in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. At least for now. '
         'Kratsios graduated from Princeton in 2008 with a political science '
         'degree and a focus on Hellenic studies. He previously served as '
         'chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the controversial Silicon Valley '
         'billionaire and Trump ally.\n'
         "The vacancy might reflect Trump's skepticism on climate change. If "
         'the president believes that the Senate would balk at a nominee who '
         'questions widely accepted views on climate change, he might prefer '
         'to leave the post open, said William Happer, an emeritus physics '
         'professor at Princeton University who is considered a leading '
         'candidate for the job. Happer says the Earth is experiencing a "CO2 '
         'famine."\n'
         '"There is no problem from CO2," Happer said last month in an '
         'interview with E&E News (Climatewire, Jan. 25).\n'
         'The Senate showed its disapproval with ideological science nominees '
         "earlier this month. Kathleen Hartnett White, Trump's pick to lead "
         'the Council on Environmental Quality, withdrew when faced with '
         'flagging Senate support. White denied that carbon dioxide was a '
         'pollutant, calling it the "gas of life" instead.\n'
         'Happer envisions a similar outcome for himself.\n'
         '"I would guess that the president feels that the sort of nominee '
         'that could pass muster with enough senators is someone that he '
         'probably doesn\'t need," said Happer, who\'s still open to serving '
         'as science adviser. "It is unlikely I could get through a '
         'confirmation hearing because I would not weasel word."\n'
         'The absence of a science adviser concerns those who have held the '
         'position. They say leaving the office vacant makes the nation more '
         'vulnerable. The position can be a quiet post for months, or even '
         'years, only to be hurled into a national crisis in an instant, said '
         'Neal Lane, who served as science adviser under President Clinton and '
         "is now a senior fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for "
         'Public Policy.\n'
         'President George W. Bush had an anthrax scare, and Obama oversaw the '
         'Deepwater Horizon disaster and an Ebola outbreak. All of them '
         'required a scientific leader to help coordinate an informed and '
         'quick response, Lane said.\n'
         'In the last year, a science adviser could have helped Trump navigate '
         'a series of deadly hurricanes and wildfires, nuclear tensions with '
         'North Korea and Iran, and climate change, observers said. All of '
         'them can be the type of situation where Cabinet secretaries and '
         "political advisers offer competing viewpoints. So it's essential to "
         'have one person who can filter those voices through an objective '
         'lens informed by science.\n'
         '"You need somebody who the president trusts, who can sort all that '
         'stuff out and who can explain to the president that there are all '
         "these different perspectives and here's why there are and here's "
         'what I think," Lane said. "There is nobody like that with regards to '
         'science, technology and engineering matters, so we have a crisis, '
         "and there may be some brewing that you and I don't know even about. "
         'Usually they come as surprises, and that\'s scary."\n'
         "It's unclear if the White House is planning to nominate a science "
         'adviser. Public schedules obtained recently by\xa0Science\xa0'
         "magazine showed some meetings on Kratsios' public calendar related "
         'to the selection of an adviser. But that happened almost a year ago. '
         'Officials from the White House and the Office of Science and '
         'Technology Policy (OSTP) did not return requests for comment.\n'
         'The post is empty during one of the worst flu seasons in more than a '
         'decade. The virus has killed dozens of people across the country.\n'
         'The science office was authorized by Congress in 1976. It currently '
         'has about 50 employees, down from about 135 when it was run by '
         "Obama's science adviser, the physicist John Holdren. Kratsios "
         'told\xa0The Wall Street Journal\xa0in November that he wants to '
         'expand the office to about 60 employees. In addition, the White '
         'House is seeking to reorganize the National Science and Technology '
         'Council, which was created in 1993, coordinates science policy and '
         'budgets across multiple agencies, and is chaired by the president.\n'
         'There is no public indication that the White House accepts the large '
         'body of scientific research that shows humans are warming the planet '
         'at an unprecedented pace, chiefly through the burning of fossil '
         'fuels. In recent weeks, Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt '
         'have claimed that global warming could benefit humanity, even though '
         'thousands of studies have found the opposite to be true.\n'
         'While Holdren focused on climate change as a crisis that required '
         'government intervention, Kratsios has repeated an administration '
         'talking point that downplays the role of human activity in rising '
         'temperatures.\n'
         '"The climate is changing, and I don\'t think anyone is disputing '
         'that," Kratsios told\xa0The Wall Street Journal\xa0in November.\n'
         "Holdren was named as Obama's science adviser before his inauguration "
         "and served for the duration of Obama's presidency. Holdren is now a "
         'professor of environmental policy at Harvard University.\n'
         "Bush's science adviser, John Marburger, took office in September "
         '2001. He was a physicist and director of the Brookhaven National '
         'Laboratory.\n'
         "Democrats and the nation's leading scientific organizations have "
         'pushed Trump to name his own science adviser, pointing out that '
         'other presidents had advisers in place at far earlier stages of '
         'their term. A group of Democrats, including Sens. Cory Booker of New '
         'Jersey and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the White '
         'House requesting that a science adviser be named as soon as '
         'possible.\n'
         '"In previous administrations, OSTP was central to disaster '
         'mitigation efforts, including hurricanes — but when Hurricane Irma, '
         'Harvey and Maria struck the U.S., OSTP lacked key leaders," the '
         'lawmakers wrote. "Scientific and technical input would also have '
         'contributed to decisions around climate change, the Iran nuclear '
         "deal and North Korea's nuclear program — areas where key decisions "
         'have been made over the past nine months in absence of a science '
         'adviser and other officials."\n'
         'An expert who rejects basic climate science will be difficult to get '
         "through the Senate, as Hartnett White's situation showed, said "
         'Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy '
         'at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n'
         'And injecting scientific objectivity into the process of rolling '

         'harder to make a wholly political decision because you have to '
         "follow the evidence, and they don't want to do that on any of the "

         'under the weight of her past comments questioning prevailing climate '

         'promoting van der Vaart for the job. "It\'s not surprising that her '
         'nomination had a few bumps and came to a bad end."\n'
         'Tim Huelskamp, president of the Heartland Institute, which rejects '
         'mainstream climate science, is another fan of van der Vaart.\n'
         '"Donald Van der Vaart would be an excellent addition to Trump\'s '
         'reform-minded administration," Huelskamp said in a statement. '
         'Huelskamp said the White House should move quickly on a nominee, '
         "saying its many vacancies have handicapped Trump's agenda.\n"
         "But the White House doesn't appear eager to advance another nominee "
         'amid a legislative push to significantly change permitting rules CEQ '

         "the interim and don't want to get bogged down in a fight over "
         'climate science with Democrats.\n'
         'Van der Vaart could ignite such a fight. While his track record on '
         'climate is less explosive than that of Hartnett White—who said '
         'fossil fuels helped end slavery and called carbon dioxide the "gas '
         'that makes life possible"—he still questions the role humans play in '
         'warming the planet.\n'
         'In an interview with E&E News yesterday, he demurred when pressed '
         'multiple times on whether he thinks humans are "significantly" '
         'contributing to climate change.\n'
         '"The question is, how well do we understand this process—and that '
         "includes the amount of global warming that's attributable to "
         'mankind—and also what are the mechanisms?" van der Vaart said. "My '
         'interest would be to see more research done in the understanding of '
         "global warming. But I'm also interested in seeing our power sector "
         "continue to get clean. I'm a big proponent of nuclear power, not "
         "only because of [carbon dioxide] but there's also no [sulfur "
         'dioxide].\n'
         '"I certainly think mankind contributes," he added. "How and how much '
         'is something I\'d like to have more answers on and more accuracy."\n'
         "If that sounds much like U.S. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's "
         "position, that's perhaps not surprising. Van der Vaart holds similar "
         'philosophies to Pruitt, a polarizing figure viewed as a boogeyman by '
         'Democrats and environmentalists and a stalwart of conservative '
         'ideals by the right and industry.\n'
         '"Don is a well-thought-of name by people who matter in the '
         'administration," said energy lobbyist Mike McKenna.\n'
         "In what's likely a promising sign to some conservatives, van der "
         "Vaart appears willing to review EPA's endangerment finding on "
         'greenhouse gases, an anthology of climate science that forms the '
         'legal justification for regulating heat-trapping emissions. He '
         'argued that the finding should be constantly updated as science '
         'progresses.\n'
         '"I think whenever there\'s a significant alteration from [the '
         'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] or somebody—this is no '
         'different than any health-based standard," van der Vaart said.\n'
         'Climate scientists contend that opening up the science would '
         'ultimately yield a win for the overwhelming body of evidence that '
         'shows humans are largely responsible for a warming planet.\n'
         'Van der Vaart said the culmination of a "red-team, blue-team" review '
         'of climate science could "warrant a revisitation of the endangerment '
         'finding." Pruitt has been pushing such a science review, and many '
         'conservatives hope that would yield an opportunity to unravel the '
         'Obama-era scientific finding.\n'
         'Van der Vaart said he supports an exercise to review climate '
         "science, though he didn't describe how it should be designed. The "
         'idea is controversial, as detractors worry it would give false '
         'equivalence to minority views on climate science.\n'
         'The White House has said such a debate is on hold, which officials '
         'reiterated to Pruitt in a meeting last Friday with President Trump, '
         'according to sources.\n'
         'A relative unknown in Washington, D.C., circles, van der Vaart '
         'nonetheless was in the running to lead EPA and later was interviewed '
         "to be Pruitt's deputy administrator (Greenwire, Dec. 5, 2016). That "
         'nomination eventually went to Andrew Wheeler, a former lobbyist and '
         'ex-aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). Van der Vaart also served on '
         'the EPA transition team.\n'
         '"I just called him up out of the blue," said Ebell, who led the EPA '
         'transition team. "I said these [goals] include, of course, '
         "abolishing the EPA, and he said, 'Sign me up!' That was somewhat "
         'tongue-in-cheek—we recognize that abolishing the EPA is not going to '
         'happen, at least in the first Trump [term]."\n'
         'A chemical engineer with a doctorate from the University of '
         'Cambridge in England, van der Vaart in November 2016 urged Trump to '
         "reduce EPA's scope and argued for repealing a section of the Clean "
         'Air Act ensuring compliance with emissions rules. Pruitt later named '
         "him to EPA's Science Advisory Board while van der Vaart was still at "
         "North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality—he had demoted "
         'himself to avoid a political firing. He resigned from the agency '
         "after the state's new leadership questioned his participation on the "
         'EPA advisory board.\n'
         "When leading the North Carolina DEQ, van der Vaart's compliance plan "
         'for the Clean Power Plan relied solely on improving power plant '
         'energy efficiency—the same inside-the-fence-line approach that '
         "Pruitt is considering in a rewrite of President Obama's signature "
         'domestic climate policy. Van der Vaart also wanted his state to join '
         'others in a lawsuit challenging the Clean Power Plan, but North '
         "Carolina's Democratic attorney general—and now governor—Roy Cooper "
         'resisted.\n'
         'That legal and regulatory lens is important for CEQ, as it plays a '
         'crucial role in interpreting the National Environmental Policy Act, '
         'which underpins permitting decisions across agencies. Van der Vaart '
         'said he thinks NEPA needs scaling back in part because laws and '
         'regulations enacted after NEPA—such as the Clean Water and Clean Air '
         'acts—have expanded the regulatory state.\n'
         '"There is a lot of redundancy in these permitting reviews," van der '
         'Vaart said. "I would try to push more down on the state. And then '
         'the other part of this is truly managerial. [CEQ has] always been '
         'such a clearinghouse, but there needs to be more active coordination '
         'among the agencies."\n'
         "That's the scope groups like the Heartland Institute want brought to "
         "the CEQ role, said Huelskamp, who lauded van der Vaart's "
         'credentials.\n'
         '"With his Ph.D. in chemical engineering, he has an extremely '
         'qualified background both in science and in law," Huelskamp said. '
         '"Plus his 20 years of experience in state government, including as '
         'secretary of environmental protection in North Carolina, he '
         'understands well how the states need to take a more purposeful role '
         'as stewards of the environment."\n'
         "Van der Vaart's critics, however, said his time as North Carolina's "
         'top environment cop underscores the dangers of handing greater '
         'authority to states, something Pruitt has also advocated. They '
         'accused van der Vaart of being too cozy with industry and slammed '
         'his handling of coal ash spills and water pollution from hog '
         'operations, charging van der Vaart ignored science that urged '
         'swifter action.\n'
         '"We felt he did more to protect polluters than North Carolina\'s '
         'environment," said Nat Mund, director of federal affairs with the '
         'Southern Environmental Law Center.\n'
         "Whether van der Vaart will have a role in the administration's "
         "environmental policies isn't up to him. Regardless, he's pleased to "

         'layers of the Earth, looking for fossil clues. Like bits of '
         'fossilized pollen, or spores.\n'
         '"And that\'s where I come in." Timo van Eldijk (EL-dike) is an '
         'evolutionary biologist at Utrecht University. He was called into '
         'action when his pollen-hunting pals noticed something altogether '
         'different, in a sample of sediment more than 200 million years old '
         'dug from a thousand feet below the surface of Germany: bits of '
         'insect.\n'
         '"I took a human nose hair, because that\'s the way you isolate these '
         'things. You have a needle tipped with a human nose hair, apparently '
         'it has just the right springiness for the isolation."\n'
         'Whose nose hair? "I don\'t actually know. There was a joke going '
         'around it was one of the professors, but we don\'t actually know."\n'
         "So, using someone's nose hair, van Eldijk picked through the sludgy "
         'sediment, and isolated the tiny scales of moth wings—the stuff that '
         'looks like dust, if you touch a butterfly or moth.\n'
         'His team scanned those scales with an electron microscope, and made '
         'a crucial discovery: some of the scales were hollow. The fossil '
         'record shows that: "First came the proboscis and then came the '
         'hollow scales. We can then infer, if we find the hollow scales, '
         'there must already have been a proboscis."\n'
         'So what’s the big deal? The finding means that these samples predate '
         'existing evidence for the first butterfly tongues by 70 million '
         'years. Which in turn implies that an early version of the proboscis, '
         "which in modern insects can pry into a flower's nooks and crannies "
         'for nectar, appears to have evolved before the appearance of '
         'flowers—not as a response. The study is in the journal Science '
         'Advances. [Timo J. B. van Eldijk et al., A Triassic-Jurassic window '
         'into the evolution of Lepidoptera]\n'
         'The early proboscis might have been used to pluck drops of liquid '
         'from the tips of ancient forms of today’s pine tree cones. And it’s '
         'clear that these sucking tongues underwent a lot of remodeling after '
         'the emergence of flowers, as flowers and moths co-evolved.\n'
         'But van Eldijk is hoping insect scales might become more widely used '
         'as a tool to investigate the ancient world. "We\'re hoping that '
         'people will start recognizing them in other places. You can even '
         'imagine a scenario in which we can reconstruct past ecosystems based '
         'on the scales you find in a core, similar to the way we do with '
         'pollen now."\n'

 'text': 'An ascendant aide in the Trump White House has warned of the threats '
         'posed by climate change, has argued for taxing carbon, has promoted '
         'wind power and was even endorsed by the Sierra Club.\n'
         "The political stock of Peter Navarro, President Trump's nationalist "
         'trade adviser, has been on the rise since he won an internal White '
         "House dispute over imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump's "
         'top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, is leaving the White House after '
         'losing the tariff battle, and Navarro is widely expected to jockey '

         'powerful figure in the Trump White House who could play a greater '
         'role in shaping administration policies across the board.\n'
         'So who is this guy?\n'
         'Navarro, 68, is a longtime economics and public policy professor '
         'known for his staunchly nationalist ideals, his withering criticisms '
         'of China and his intolerance of opposing views. He was an aspiring '
         'politician for a decade, losing in his attempts to become San '
         "Diego's mayor and a California congressman. He's a "
         'Democrat-turned-Trump-supporter who fought development in San Diego, '
         'worked with local environmentalists and proudly trumpeted the Sierra '
         "Club's endorsement of his candidacy.\n"
         'He also has energy credentials—he was a policy analyst at the '
         'Massachusetts Energy Office and the Energy Department in the late '
         "1970s and a research associate at Harvard University's Energy and "
         'Environmental Policy Center in the early 1980s.\n'
         'His prolific writings and public statements on the environment put '
         'him at odds with Trump, who has famously called global warming a '
         'hoax.\n'
         '"Global climate change resulting from the widespread burning of '
         'fossil fuels has the potential to be one of the most important '
         'environmental problems of our time," Navarro said in a 2000 paper he '
         'co-wrote with a doctoral student in economics. Navarro was then an '
         'associate professor at the University of California, Irvine. The '
         'paper promoted wind power as a "weapon in the arsenal to combat '
         'global warming."\n'
         'In a 2007 paper, Navarro said "that global warming is a very '
         'significant problem and that carbon dioxide emissions are the '
         'principal cause of global warming."\n'
         'He\'s also promoted a carbon tax, writing in 2007, "Economists '
         'correctly and perennially argue that the most efficient and direct '
         'path to American energy independence and clean skies would simply be '
         'to tax oil imports and gasoline as well as carbon."\n'
         'Navarro has even called for banning incandescent light bulbs, a move '
         'favored by environmentalists but loathed by many conservatives. "Our '
         'outrage is rooted in a classic mistrust of government interference," '
         'Navarro wrote in 2007. "But there are very sound economic reasons to '
         '\'ban the bulb.\'"\n'
         'Decades ago, Navarro was even something of a hero among local '
         'environmentalists in San Diego.\n'
         'Navarro founded the slow-growth group Prevent Los Angelization Now, '
         'an organization that fought developers and promoted open spaces.\n'
         'He was "an environmental pit bull in San Diego," said Peter '
         'Andersen, a retired professor of communications at San Diego State '
         "University who worked for Navarro's four failed political campaigns. "
         'In the early 1990s, then-City Council member Bob Filner voted to '
         'allow a road through an urban wilderness park, which Andersen and '
         'Navarro staunchly opposed.\n'
         'Filner—a Democrat who was later elected to Congress and as San '
         'Diego\'s mayor—"lied to us" about his vote, recalled Andersen, '
         "who's now on the board of the Sierra Club's San Diego chapter. "
         '"Peter literally got up out of the audience" and "excoriated him '
         'with profanities and threats," Andersen said. Navarro told him, '
         '"You\'re dead in politics; you don\'t even belong in this town."\n'
         'Andersen called Navarro a complex character. "There\'s a lot I like '
         'about the guy; he\'s a doer," Andersen said. Also, he said, "he\'s '
         'kind of a jerk."\n'
         "His green credentials aren't an indication that he'll try to sway "
         'the president on that front, according to sources who have worked '
         'with him. Above all, they see Navarro as a political opportunist '
         "who's willing to change his policy positions and even his political "
         'party to advance his career.\n'
         '"He\'s an environmental opportunist," said Scott Flexo, who worked '
         'as a pollster for Navarro during his 1992 campaign for San Diego '
         'mayor. "I think he would focus on the environment if it would sell '
         'books or if it would get him jobs or get him elected. There really '
         "wasn't a commitment to environmental issues, and you could see that "
         'in his behavior and after the election."\n'
         "One of the big discussions during Navarro's 1992 campaign, Flexo "
         'recalled, was which political party Navarro would choose. He '
         'ultimately ran as an independent, losing to the Republican '
         'candidate, Susan Golding.\n'
         'He called himself a "grass-roots" candidate in that race, the\xa0Los '
         'Angeles Times\xa0reported. "On the environment, I\'m endorsed by the '
         'Sierra Club; she\'s financed by the building industry," he said of '
         'Golding.\n'
         'But he no longer has the Sierra Club\'s backing. "Any good will '
         'Peter Navarro had in 1992 has been squandered by his myopic '
         'worldview and work on behalf of a hateful, xenophobic '
         'administration," Sierra Club spokesman Adam Beitman said yesterday '
         'in a statement.\n'
         'Golding only narrowly beat Navarro in that race, an outcome Flexo '
         "attributed to Navarro's treatment of Golding during a televised "
         'debate.\n'
         "Golding's husband had been arrested by the FBI in 1989 on charges "
         'that he had agreed to launder more than $1 million he thought came '
         'from South American cocaine dealers, United Press International '
         "reported at the time. Navarro's aides had considered whether to "
         'bring it up during the campaign.\n'
         '"Peter just decided to bring it up on television in a debate. He '
         "brought it up, and she started to cry, and he didn't know what to do "
         'when she was crying," Flexo said. "She was able to pick up quite a '
         'bit of votes from women who felt like he was beating up on her, '
         "because he's very intense and his criticisms of her were very "
         'pointed and direct."\n'
         "That wasn't the only bad press Navarro suffered during the campaign. "
         "Earlier that year, Navarro acknowledged that he had called Golding's "
         'press secretary, Nikki Symington, a "pig" when "the two engaged in a '
         'brief shoving match," according to the\xa0Los Angeles Times. '
         '"Navarro was captured on television forcing his way past the '
         'diminutive Symington as he attempted to join Golding, who was being '
         'interviewed."\n'
         'The anecdotes match his reputation as a hard-charging political '
         'climber.\n'
         '"He\'s articulate and smart but verbally very aggressive," said Bob '
         'Meadow, a partner at Lake Research Partners who worked as a pollster '
         'for Golding during the 1992 mayoral race and later worked for '
         'Navarro when he ran as a Democrat attempting to unseat California '
         'Republican Rep. Brian Bilbray in 1996.\n'
         "Navarro's former campaign aides don't expect Navarro to push Trump "
         'to the left on the environment.\n'
         '"It\'s extremely difficult for me to say that there is any '
         'ideological grounding to Peter Navarro," Meadow said. "I believe '
         'deeply that he is pandering to Trump and that any of the strong '
         'environmental positions he held would bend."\n'
         'Flexo called Navarro a "chameleon" whose "policy positions will be '
         'the policy positions that will get him the job and keep him the '
         'job." Flexo, who\'s now a marketing professor at California State '
         'University, Long Beach, kept in touch with Navarro after the failed '
         '1992 campaign and would occasionally teach classes for him.\n'
         'Asked if they are personal friends, Flexo said, "Oh no. ... Peter is '
         "a very driven person; he's not a personable person, so you can't "
         'really get close to Peter." He added, "He can grate on you if '
         'you\'re not ready and prepared for that kind of a person."\n'
         'Others find him more approachable. Former Rep. Bob Walker (R-Pa.), '
         'who was chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology '
         'Committee, penned an article with Navarro in 2016 about space policy '
         'when they were both Trump campaign advisers. Walker called him a '
         '"very bright, engaging guy." He added, "I found him to be very '
         'interesting."\n'
         "He's an odd fit in the Trump White House, with no natural allies.\n"
         "There's widespread belief that major staff defections would follow "
         "Navarro's potential promotion to the top of the National Economic "
         'Council. His protectionist views run counter to those of the '
         "free-trade, establishment Republican advisers filling the council's "
         'ranks.\n'
         "Navarro said yesterday that he's not in the running to replace Cohn. "
         '"I\'d be honored, but I\'m not on that list, let me be clear," he '
         'said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. "I\'ve got a very full plate '
         'here at the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy."\n'
         "Still, his recent policy victory and Cohn's departure have shined a "
         'brighter spotlight on what Navarro might do with more leverage in '
         'the administration.\n'
         'Despite his past warnings about climate change, he was a supporter '
         "of Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. He "
         'wrote in a July 2017\xa0USA Today\xa0op-ed\xa0that withdrawal "will '
         'save the U.S. economy an estimated 6.5 million industrial-sector '
         'jobs, and his regulatory rollbacks have already saved more than $60 '
         'billion in unnecessary costs for American companies."\n'
         'He added that Trump "has unleashed America\'s energy potential—a '
         'great boon for American manufacturers and consumers. And employment '
         'in the coal industry is up, contrary to the cynics\' forecast."\n'
         'But he has also contradicted major Trump administration energy '
         "policy goals. He's pushed back on plans to help build fossil fuel "
         'generators overseas, instead arguing to export renewable energy or '
         'help other nations develop their own ability to produce clean '
         'energy.\n'
         "Exporting fuel, another tenet of Trump's energy and economic policy, "
         "is also anathema to Navarro's worldview, said a source close to the "
         'administration. Navarro operates within the long-standing paradigm '
         'of energy independence that prizes domestic energy as a strategic '
         'and security advantage enabling disengagement with other nations.\n'
         '"I\'ve never gotten the impression that he\'s a strong proponent for '
         'fossil energy exports. He\'s more of an isolationist," said the '
         'source. "He would be 100 percent in favor of energy independence. He '
         'would be skeptical of any international agreement—he would oppose '
         'any international agreement that would harm the U.S."\n'
         'In addition to backing tariffs on steel and aluminum, Navarro was a '
         'strong proponent of slapping tariffs on imported solar panels, which '
         'he saw as hitting his top adversary: China. His position as a key '
         'player promoting tariffs has made him a convenient punching bag for '
         "White House officials who disagree with the president's trade moves, "
         'a former administration official said.\n'
         'It remains unclear how high Navarro will climb, but some of his '
         'former associates say he may already have achieved his main career '
         'objective.\n'
         '"Peter\'s career goal was to get to Washington," Flexo said. "He was '
         'going to become mayor of San Diego and then leverage that into some '
         'other position, senator or congressman. ... His goal was always to '
         'get to Washington, and now he\'s made it."\n'
         'Meadow said Navarro has always sought "power and having a place to '
         'articulate his perspective." Lately, he added, Navarro has been '
         "interested in trade and the rise of China, and Trump's adviser has "
         '"a willing audience of one."\n'

         'Though it has little chance of being enacted, the Trump '
         "administration's budget proposal unveiled yesterday targets hundreds "
         'of millions of dollars in climate science, renewable energy research '
         'and climate mitigation efforts across a variety of federal agencies, '
         'including NASA, NOAA, U.S. EPA and the departments of the Interior '
         'and Energy.\n'
         "Many of the proposals are a reprise of last year's spending plan "
         'from the White House, which congressional appropriators largely '
         'rejected. Already, Republicans and Democrats alike have slammed some '
         "of the White House's latest spending proposals and promised they "
         'would not survive congressional scrutiny.\n'
         'The new White House proposal calls for a reduction in climate '
         'research at NASA, including a 6 percent cut to earth science '
         'programs for fiscal 2019. The budget request calls for an overall '
         'funding increase of more than 2 percent at NASA, which would have a '
         '$19.9 billion budget.\n'
         'The NASA budget request calls for an end to financing for the '
         'International Space Station and a push to encourage private '
         'investment in that work, but Democrats and Republicans in the Senate '
         'have said that is a non-starter. Increasing privatization of the '
         'space industry has been a priority of congressional Republicans as '
         'well as Vice President Mike Pence—who chairs the revived National '
         'Space Council—over the last year.\n'
         'Once again, the administration has proposed eliminating a number of '
         'climate-related satellite programs, including the functions of some '
         'already in orbit. The total savings would be $133 million for the '
         'five missions, including the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean '
         'Ecosystem (PACE) mission, which is scheduled for a 2022 launch. As '
         'with most satellites, PACE has multiple functions and can be used to '
         'forecast harmful algal blooms, which have plagued the Great Lakes in '
         "recent years. Trump's proposal would also eliminate the "
         'Earth-observing abilities of the Deep Space Climate Observatory, '
         'which was proposed by then-Vice President Al Gore and also measures '
         'solar storms.\n'
         '"We can\'t do everything, and as always, we\'ve had to make hard '
         'choices, but we will continue to forge new paths and partnerships '
         'that strengthen our industrial base and our engagement with other '
         'nations to achieve challenging goals that advance our capabilities '
         'and increase our security and economic strength," acting NASA '
         'Administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement.\n'
         'At NOAA, the budget would be trimmed 20 percent, by about $1 '
         'billion, to $4.6 billion in 2019. The White House called for the '
         'elimination of $273 million in grants, something that congressional '
         'appropriators have also rejected. Those include the National Sea '
         'Grant College Program, the National Estuarine Research Reserve '
         'System, coastal zone management grants, the Office of Education and '
         'the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund.\n'
         "The Interior Department's chief science agency would take a major "
         'hit under the proposed budget. The U.S. Geological Survey is the '
         'lead federal agency in providing science and mapping on ecosystems, '
         'energy and mineral resources, water use and natural hazards like '
         'earthquakes and volcanoes. It would receive just under $860 million, '
         'about a 20 percent decrease from funding levels enacted for fiscal '
         "2017. The White House's proposal is $62 million less than it asked "
         'for last year to fund USGS (see related story).\n'
         'The budget request includes $13 million to fund only three of the '
         'eight regional climate science centers and one national climate '
         'adaptation science center—the others would presumably close. That is '
         '$4.4 million less than the administration allocated in its fiscal '
         '2018 budget proposal and less than half of what Congress enacted for '
         'fiscal 2017. Established by Congress in 2008, the climate science '
         'centers develop science and tools to help land managers address '
         'climate change-related impacts to land, water, fish and wildlife, '
         'and cultural sites.\n'
         'All other climate change research at USGS would be renamed under the '
         'new "land resources" program, formerly the "climate and land use '
         'change program."\n'
         'The phrase "climate change" only appears once in the narrative '
         "summary of Trump's budget request, and that is for the proposed "
         'elimination of the Climate Change Research and Partnership Programs '
         'at EPA. However, there are some areas where climate-related research '
         'is supported. For instance, U.S. facilities in Antarctica would be '
         'upgraded through a $2.2 billion funding package that is part of the '
         'congressional budget deal reached last week.\n'
         "Trump's budget proposal would also slash funding for EPA's Office of "
         'Science and Technology to $449 million, down from $714 million in '
         'fiscal 2017 enacted levels. The number of full-time-equivalent staff '
         'positions would also fall to 1,481 in fiscal 2019 from 2,124 under '
         'fiscal 2017 enacted levels.\n'
         "Meanwhile, the administration touted EPA's continued commitment to "
         'improve air and water quality.\n'
         '"These activities prioritize robust science, refocusing EPA\'s '
         'research and scientific analysis to inform EPA policy and regulatory '
         'development actions, and creating consistency and certainty that '
         'outlines exactly what is expected of the regulated community to '
         'ensure good stewardship and positive environmental outcomes," the '
         'budget request read.\n'
         'On the climate front, EPA would continue to implement renewable fuel '
         'provisions under 2005 and 2007 energy laws and would "ensure '
         'compliance" of regulations aimed at reducing emissions from "highway '
         'and non-road sources." The agency would also continue to track '
         'greenhouse gas emissions nationally and has suggested maintaining '
         'the popular voluntary Energy Star program (see related story).\n'
         "Some of the Trump administration's targeted reductions in climate "
         'research could be offset by the bipartisan spending plan reached by '
         'lawmakers last week.\n'
         'For example, the White House plan includes a request for the '
         'National Science Foundation to receive a 30 percent cut, but that '
         'request was amended after the congressional spending plan was agreed '
         'to last week. In an addendum to its budget, NSF would receive $7.5 '
         'billion, which would keep its funding flat compared with 2017 '
         'levels.\n'
         "Similarly, the Department of Energy's science programs would have "
         'seen a 22 percent reduction under the White House proposal, but the '
         'funding amount was updated to $5.4 billion, which means they would '
         'essentially remain flat.\n'
         "Under Trump's plan, DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy—a "
         'high-tech research division that has worked on more durable solar '
         'cells and lighter batteries—would be eliminated, although that is '
         'not likely to happen. Senators advocated for record levels of '
         'funding for ARPA-E for fiscal 2018.\n'
         '"Budgets are about priorities, and a close examination of this '
         "year's request shows the direction we're seeking to lead the "
         'department," Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a call with '
         'reporters yesterday. "Budgets are also about making difficult '
         'choices, but it would be a mistake to judge our view of the merits '
         'of any program solely on a one-year budget request."\n'
         "Congressional Democrats widely panned the administration's spending "
         'plan.\n'
         'Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), ranking member of the House '
         'Science, Space and Technology Committee, said the plan shows that '
         'the Trump administration has no appreciation for the role that '
         'research at federal agencies plays in driving the economy or '
         'protecting the environment and public health.\n'
         '"When I was first briefed on \'highlights\' of President Trump\'s '
         'budget request, I was incredulous at its treatment of our federal '
         'science agencies," she said in a statement. "The only good thing '

 'text': "It's a given of climate change that greenhouse gases emitted today "
         'will shape the world for future generations. But new research '
         'underscores just how long those effects will last.\n'
         'A striking new\xa0study\xa0published yesterday in the journal\xa0'
         'Nature Communications\xa0suggests that sea-level rise—one of the '
         'biggest consequences of global warming—will still be happening 300 '
         'years from now, even if humans stop emitting greenhouse gases before '
         'the end of the current century.\n'
         "What's more, the longer it takes to start reducing global emissions, "
         'the higher those future sea levels will be. The study suggests that '
         'for every additional five years it takes for emissions to peak and '
         'start falling—for instance, if emissions were to reach their maximum '
         'levels in the year 2030, as opposed to 2025—sea levels will rise an '
         'additional 8 inches by the year 2300.\n'
         '"The Paris Agreement calls for emissions to peak as soon as '
         'possible," researcher Carl-Friedrich Schleussner of the Potsdam '
         "Institute for Climate Impact Research, one of the study's "
         'co-authors, said in a statement about the new paper. "This might '
         'sound like a hollow phrase to some, but our results show that there '
         'are quantifiable consequences of delaying action."\n'
         'The study emphasizes an important scientific concern about the '
         "progression of climate change—that its effects don't always occur "
         'immediately, or even quickly in some cases. Even after humans stop '
         'emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, global temperatures '
         'are expected to continue rising before they finally stabilize, '
         'potentially for decades. And even after temperatures stop rising, '
         'other effects of climate change may continue to go on for hundreds '
         'of years.\n'
         'Sea-level rise is one example. Rising seas are caused by the '
         'combination of a number of different processes, including the '
         'warming of the ocean, which causes the water to expand in volume, '
         'and the melting of glaciers—particularly from the massive Greenland '
         'and Antarctic ice sheets. Both of these processes may continue long '
         'after human-caused greenhouse gas emissions have come to a halt.\n'
         'The melting of the ice sheets, in particular, is a process that may '
         "be difficult to stop once it's set in motion. Even after global "
         'temperatures stabilize—and even if they stabilize within the '
         '2-degree Celsius threshold outlined under the Paris climate '
         'agreement—the warming that occurs up to that point may destabilize '
         'the glaciers to an extent that continued ice loss becomes '
         'unstoppable far into the future.\n'
         'In short, scientists generally believe that current greenhouse gas '
         'emissions have already committed the world to significant levels of '
         'sea-level rise for generations to come. The question is how much—and '
         'to what extent different strategies for curbing emissions now may '
         'mitigate sea-level rise in the future.\n'
         'To investigate, the authors of the new study—led by Matthias Mengel '
         'of the Potsdam Institute—used climate and sea-level models to '
         'simulate a range of scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions. '
         'In this study, each of the scenarios assumes the 2 C temperature '
         'target is ultimately met, but they differ in how quickly global '
         'emissions peak and fall to zero.\n'
         'These scenarios are in keeping with reports from the '
         'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has presented a '
         'range of possible emissions-reduction scenarios consistent with the '
         '2 C target. For instance, global emissions could peak in the year '
         '2020, and then fall at a certain rate every year afterward in order '
         'to stabilize temperatures within a 2 C threshold. Or they could peak '
         'at a later date—in 2030 or even 2035, for instance—and fall at a '
         'much faster rate to still meet the target. Generally, each of these '
         'trajectories assumes that human-caused emissions must cease entirely '
         'by about midcentury.\n'
         'Within these scenarios, the new study finds that sea levels will '
         "likely rise by between 2.3 and 4 feet by the year 2300—and they'll "
         'likely continue to rise even beyond that point. But peaking '
         'emissions earlier will keep sea levels at the lower end of the '
         'spectrum, the research notes. Every five-year delay in the peak '
         'tacks another 20 centimeters, or nearly 8 inches, on to the total '
         'estimate for 2300.\n'
         'The findings are generally consistent with other recent studies, '
         'according to sea-level expert R. Steve Nerem of the University of '
         'Colorado, Boulder, in a comment to E&E News about the new research, '
         'and "help us as we seek to understand how sea level will respond '
         'under different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions."\n'
         'And these scenarios are all assuming that the 2 C target is met—a '
         'goal scientists increasingly believe is slipping out of reach. For '
         'the time being, most researchers agree that the individual pledges '
         'world nations have submitted under the Paris climate agreement are '
         'still not strong enough to meet that goal. If temperatures rise '
         'beyond that point, future sea-level rise will be even worse.\n'
         'Other recent research, focusing on more near-term sea-level-rise '
         'projections, has helped to drive that point home. Several studies in '
         'the last year or so have suggested that sea levels are not only '
         'rising, but the rate of increase is actually accelerating.\n'
         'Just this month, a\xa0paper\xa0in the\xa0Proceedings of the National '
         'Academy of Sciences\xa0suggested that sea levels have been rising by '
         'an average of about 3 millimeters (around one-tenth of an inch) per '
         'year since the 1990s, and that the rate is gradually speeding up. If '
         'the process continues at its current rate, sea levels could rise by '
         'more than 2 feet by the end of this century alone.\n'
         'Other recent studies have also suggested that previous estimates of '
         'sea-level rise, under a variety of future climate scenarios, may be '
         'too modest. Several papers in the last year, for instance—including '
         'an October\xa0paper\xa0in\xa0Environmental Research Letters\xa0and a '
         "December\xa0paper\xa0in\xa0Earth's Future—suggest that better "
         'accounting for some of the physical processes affecting ice loss in '
         'Antarctica could significantly increase estimates of future '
         'sea-level rise. Under severe climate change scenarios, these new '
         'studies suggest that sea levels could rise by more than 4 feet by '
         'the end of the century.\n'
         "There's still a great deal of uncertainty associated with sea-level "
         'projections, particularly so far in the future, that largely hinges '
         "on scientists' developing understanding of how the world's ice "
         'sheets will respond to continued warming and the physical processes '
         'that mold those responses. Recent research tends to suggest that the '
         'future may carry more risks than previously suspected and that human '
         'societies should be planning accordingly.\n'
         'But while the new study reaffirms that climate change carries '
         'consequences for hundreds of years to come, climate targets '
         'notwithstanding, it also emphasizes that earlier, more aggressive '
         'climate action now may still improve life for generations yet to be '

         'To test the idea, Munoz and colleagues set up minnow traps with and '
         'without glow sticks at a dozen vernal pools in Centre County, '
         'Pennsylvania. The critters gather at the pools to breed.\n'
         'For a month, they trapped and tracked numbers of the Jefferson '
         'salamander, the spotted salamander, the wood frog and the eastern '
         'red-spotted newt. “Right before we left for the day, around 4 P.M., '
         'we’d activate the glow stick and hang it on the little minnow trap, '
         'come back the next day to see what we got.”\n'
         'Traps with glow sticks were vastly more productive. “We were really '
         'surprised by how strong of an effect our glow sticks had on our '
         'captures. So, by just putting a glow stick in one of these minnow '
         'traps we increased the capture rates for our spotted salamanders and '
         'our Jefferson salamanders between on average two to four times.” And '
         'for the eastern red-spotted newt, the glow stick traps lured six '

         '“You know, these salamanders and these amphibians are going to these '
         'sites to breed. And so what are they looking for? They’re looking '
         'for other individuals…and so what we think is that the glow stick is '
         'either making the movement of other salamanders more apparent, or '
         "it's potentially just a simple visual cue…their eyes are sensitive "
         'to this type of light, so they might be attracted to it.”\n'
         'Regardless of the reason, Munoz hopes his team’s glowing discovery '
         'will benefit amphibians. “In order to help manage those species, and '
         'help bring them back, or reverse those declines, we need to '
         'understand what’s causing those declines. And the way we do that is '
         'by monitoring populations.”\n'
         'Another nice thing about glow sticks: they’re cheap. “It gives '

         'Hellmuth Margulis, The Sound-to-Music Illusion: Repetition Can '
         'Musicalize Non-Speech Sounds, in press]\n'
         'A few years back, psychologists at the University of California, San '
         'Diego, discovered that when words or phrases are repeated a few '
         'times, they can start to sound more like singing than speaking.\n'
         '<<“The sounds as they appear to you are not only different from '
         'those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so '
         'strangely as to seem quite impossible. But they sometimes behave so '
         'strangely. Sometimes behave so strangely. Sometimes behave so '
         'strangely. So strangely. So strangely. So strangely. So strangely.” '
         'Credit: speech to song illusion/Deutsch>>\n'
         'The effect is perhaps not entirely surprising. Talking and singing '
         'are both forms of vocal communication. But researchers got to '
         'wondering: could repetition also musicalize other types of sounds?\n'
         'So they collected clips of 20 different environmental '
         'sounds…including water dripping, ice cracking, whales calling, and '
         'the aforementioned shovel. And they played the snippets to 58 '
         'undergraduates…first, as single sounds <<single whale call>> and '
         'then in a series with increasing reiteration <<whale call '
         'repeated>>.\n'
         'What they found is that…as the repeats stacked up…the participants '
         'rated the sounds as being more tuneful.\n'

         '“We found that they were using parks like you might expect, but when '

         'The study’s researchers had previously examined the bones of '

         'provide a record of the sort of activities in which an individual '
         'regularly engages. So, at the dawn of agriculture, men’s leg bones '
         'were strong, like today’s cross-country runners. But by the late '
         'Iron Age, their leg bones looked more like that of the average couch '
         'potato.\n'
         '“So this kind of matched with declines in mobility as people became '
         'more sedentary through time.”\n'
         'Alison Macintosh, who did that work when she was an undergraduate '
         'student in archaeology at the University of Cambridge.\n'
         '“But we didn’t see these drops in women. Their leg bone strength was '
         'consistently lower than men’s, it didn’t change significantly '
         'through time. So really the women just looked quite sedentary pretty '
         'much right from the get-go. And we didn’t think that was very '
         'probably necessarily a very accurate representation of what they had '
         'been doing.”\n'
         'Now, it could be that prehistoric housewives sat around and lunched '
         'their way through the Neolithic. But Macintosh thought that '
         'unlikely. Instead, she and her colleagues figured that the bones of '
         'men and women react differently under pressure. So Macintosh, now a '
         'postdoctoral fellow with the same group, decided to look at the '
         'limbs of some ladies.\n'
         'She recruited 18 championship rowers, 11 soccer players, 17 runners '
         'and 37 somewhat less sporty undergrads. And she scanned their upper '
         'arms and lower legs. What she found is that the leg bone strength of '
         'prehistoric women was as variable as that of her living subjects, '
         'running the gamut from those who run marathons to those who engage '
         'in marathon study sessions. But the arms were a different story.\n'
         '“We found that prehistoric women had stronger arm bones on average '
         'than most living women. That was pretty consistent through the first '
         '5,500 years of farming or so. So this was even stronger than the arm '
         'bones of the rowers. So for example women in the earliest time '
         'period that we looked at, which is the early Neolithic period about '
         '7,000 years ago, they had arm bones that were 30 percent stronger '
         'than nonathletes today, so just recreationally active women in '
         'Cambridge. And they’re about 16 percent stronger bones than those of '
         'the living rowers.”\n'
         'That power most likely came from tilling the soil, harvesting crops, '
         'and spending hours a day milling grain to make flour with a '
         'stone-age mortar and pestle. The findings shed light on the daily '

         'Rift Valley, she focused her attention on two neighboring sites: a '
         'national park with lots of lions, and a privately owned conservancy '

         'In the lion-free conservancy, 26 percent of the giraffes were less '
         'than one year old. But in the lion-filled park, juvenile giraffes '
         'made up only 5 percent of the species’ population.\n'
         '"So I was able to show that in the presence of lions, the number of '

         'lot higher than I thought it would be. Quite shocking, actually."\n'

         'breed and produce offspring of their own.\n'
         'The study compares only two sites in East Africa. But it highlights '

         'Allowing for the conservation of both species in the same areas is '

         'the large herbivores, as the tide starts to drop they seem to know '
         'it, and they jet. And it\'s really predictable."\n'

         'acquired, who are these furry fliers imitating? Their parents? Or '
         'their roost-mates?\n'
         'To find out, Yossi Yovall at Tel Aviv University and his colleagues '
         'captured 15 pregnant fruit bats and divided them into three groups, '
         'each of which was housed in its own separate box. The mothers gave '
         'birth inside these boxes and their babies, called pups, lived there '
         'for a full year. During that time, the researchers exposed the pups '
         'to a select symphony of bat sounds. Fruit bats in the wild are '
         'reared in colonies that contain dozens to thousands of individuals, '
         'so they’re used to being surrounded by a cacophony of calls and '
         'other vocal communiques.\n'
         'For one of the boxes, Yovall and his team exposed the young batlings '
         'to a selection of squeaks that were biased toward the higher '
         'frequencies. Pups in the second box heard lower-pitched peeps. And '
         'the third box got a random sampling of fruit bat hits that was heavy '
         'on the mid-range frequencies but also included those at either end '
         'of the aural spectrum.\n'
         '“And what we found is that they were influenced by the playback that '
         'they heard.”\n'
         'Yossi Yovall.\n'
         '“So the control group was using a vocal repertoire that was '
         'identical to their mothers and identical to fruit bats in the colony '
         'here in Israel. But the two manipulated groups were using different '
         'dialects...we actually were able to create three different groups of '
         'fruit bats with three different dialects in the lab.”\n'
         'Of course, birds are famous for their songs. Which the males learn '
         'from tutors, typically their dads. But Yovall says when it comes to '
         'vocal learning, bats march to a different drummer.\n'
         '“Here we show that even though the pups were with their mothers, '
         'they were exposed to their mother’s normal repertoire, they were '
         'still influenced by the background vocalizations that they heard. '
         'Now this is probably extremely reasonable in the case of bats '
         'because bats roost in these caves with many hundreds of '
         'individuals…we believe that this process, which we call crowd vocal '
         'learning, because you learn from the entire crowd, is relevant for '
         'many other animals that live in crowded colonies.”\n'

         'factor…and how much is written in their genes. So they studied '
         'Bengalese finches.. which sing like this. <<finch clip 1>>\n'
         "The tempo of that song appears to vary, according to a finch's "
         'genetics. So they tried training baby finches, with different '
         'genetic tendencies - fast, medium or slow singing - on a synthetic '

         'syllables. "Tonal downward sweeps, <whistle> you know. Or sort of '

         'Marielle Ong, a researcher at the University of Queensland in '

         'flew through the wider opening, which makes sense. Less chances of '

         'produce the sound, whether it is actually a signal, and whether it’s '
         'a reliable signal.”\n'
         'The team focused their experiment on specific feathers in the '

         'pigeons. “And from this experiment we were able to see that the '
         'eighth primary feather, the unusual feather, was actually crucial '
         'for signaling alarm. When that eighth primary feather was missing, '
         'they very rarely responded. They almost never fled. Whereas when the '
         'neighboring feather that produces the other part of the sound, that '
         'ninth primary, they actually fled just as much as to normal alarms. '
         'This shows us that this unusual primary feather is crucial for '
         'signaling alarm, and together that suggests that it has evolved to '

         'being put into the atmosphere, we have a good signature that it’s '
         'influencing the nature of storms, and then we can use this '
         'experiment as a way to improve our understanding of how pollution '
         'affects the development of storms and their intensity.”\n'

 'text': 'Humans are hardly alone in their need for sleep—as any cat owner '
         'knows. But what about other, very different animals?\n'
         '“In thinking about this…we wanted to use an evolutionary argument to '
         'figure out what is the simplest animal to sleep.” Ravi Nath, a '
         'graduate student of biology and bioengineering at Caltech.\n'
         '“We decided to approach it from a conservation point of view, how '
         'conserved the sleep state is. And looked back into the animal tree '
         'and specifically looked at jellyfish.” Claire Bedbrook, also a '
         'biology and bioengineering graduate student at Caltech.\n'
         'Jellyfish have no central nervous system. “They do have '
         'neurons—their nervous system is a sort of loose set of neurons that '
         'control the animal’s behavior. There’s no control center.”\n'
         'Nath, Bedbrook and the rest of their team worked with a species '
         'known as the upside-down jellyfish. “Unlike jellyfish that we’re '
         'probably most used to seeing in the wild, these jellyfish actually '
         'rest their bell on the seafloor, or in our case the tank bottom, and '
         'they pulse in place.” These habits made this jellyfish easy to '
         'observe.\n'
         'The researchers recorded the animals’ behavior during the day and at '
         'night, to see if these jellyfish met the scientific criteria for '
         'sleep. “Those three behavioral criteria are, first, that the animal '
         'goes through a period of quiescence where they are less active. The '
         'second is that during this quiescent state, the animals are not as '
         'responsive to environmental stimulus. And the third is that this '
         'quiescent state is actually necessary for the animal’s well-being '
         'and survival.”\n'
         'The observations revealed that these jellyfish do in fact sleep. '
         'That’s a big deal because for scientists “there was this assumption '
         'in the community that you needed to have a certain level of '
         'complexity”—namely a central nervous system—“to actually sleep. And '
         'I think this study really challenges that assumption.” The finding '
         'is in the journal Current Biology. [Ravi D. Nath, Claire N. Bedbrook '
         'et al., The Jellyfish Cassiopea Exhibits a Sleep-like State]\n'
         'So what does this study tell us about why animals sleep, and how '
         'sleep evolved? Bedbrook says that although more work needs to be '
         'done, they have some ideas. “One hypothesis that we really like is '
         'that any animal that has neurons will have a sleep state, and that '
         'sleep might be an intrinsic property of neurons.” Nath agrees. “So '
         'neurons have a huge metabolic cost, and so maybe this period of '
         'sleep is a period of consolidated energy conservation that has '
         'evolved with neurons essentially.”\n'
         'So nerves might be keeping you up at night—but having nerves is '
         'what’s probably putting you to sleep.\n'

         "Biologist Bibiana Rojas from Finland's University of Jyväskylä.\n"
         'Animals that pair visual warnings with other defenses are called '

         'glance, this seems like a fairly routine sort of defensive strategy. '
         'After all, nature is full of redundant processes.\n'
         'But the researchers discovered that the wood tiger moth is the first '
         'species known in which the different fluids from the different parts '
         'of the moths’ body each target a different type of predator.\n'
         'The fluids from the moth’s abdomen deter ants, but are completely '
         'useless against birds. Meanwhile, the neck fluids are unpalatable to '
         'birds, but don’t bother ants. In fact, the ants actually preferred '

         'enemies: target specific chemical defenses in an aposematic moth.]\n'

         'al., Escaping blood-fed malaria mosquitoes minimize tactile '
         'detection without compromising on take-off speed]\n'
         'Feasting on an unsuspecting mammal can double a mosquito’s body '
         'mass. So how does a fully loaded female heave that added bulk off '
         'the skin of her host without triggering its pressure sensors and '
         'bringing on that fateful slap? To find out, Florian Muijres of '
         'Wageningen University in The Netherlands and his colleagues used '
         'cameras that record 13,500 frames per second to capture the takeoff '
         'maneuvers of 63 blood-fed malarial mosquitoes.\n'
         'What they discovered is, when it comes to a soft yet speedy '
         'getaway…for female skeeters, the wing’s the thing. With a wingbeat '
         'frequency of about 600 beats per second…the insects are able to lift '
         'themselves lightly off their host. That approach is the opposite of '
         'the one favored by most other winged things, says Muijres.\n'
         '“Most flying animals when they take off, like birds or a fly for, '
         'example, they first use their legs to push off very hard, and then '
         'when they are in the air, then they start beating their wings and '
         'generate aerodynamic lift to be able to fly away. Mosquito does it '
         'the other way around. It first starts beating its wings and through '
         'the aerodynamic forces these wings generate, their body is being '
         'lifted off from the substrate. And then they also do gently push '
         'down with their long legs to be able to further power their liftoff. '
         'But these forces that are being generated by the legs are relatively '
         'small.”\n'
         'In fact, the faint flutter of a mosquito’s wings produces less than '
         'one third of the force exerted by similar-sized but much less subtle '
         'fruit flies as they shove off in search of another banana. And even '
         'on a full stomach, these bloodsuckers are stunningly fast, says '
         'Muijres. “So takeoff phase takes only about 30 milliseconds, which '
         'is 10 times faster than how fast we can blink our eye.” And they’re '
         'gone before we know what hit us. And before we can hit them.\n'

         'risen, from about 315 parts per million, to 405. And plants enjoy '

         'So what’s water-use efficiency? Like us, plants need water for basic '

         'precious water out. Higher water-use efficiency just means losing '
         'less water while taking in the CO2.\n'
         'To figure that just how much the efficiency improves, Keeling and '

         '13 versus its lighter and much more prevalent cousin, carbon 12. "So '
         "the ratio is 0.2 percent lower than it was pre-industrially. Doesn't "

         'And yet, that small change in carbon 13 versus carbon 12 allowed '

 'text': 'In 1869, the Smiley family purchased\xa0a parcel\xa0of land about '
         '100 miles north of New York City.\xa0Over time, some of their '
         'property and much of the surrounding landscape became the Mohonk '
         'Preserve, which has since grown to 8,000 acres and\xa0attracts '
         'droves of visitors to its thick forests and rugged crags — popular '
         'among rock climbers.\n'
         'But the Mohonk Preserve also has a long scientific legacy. In the '
         '1930s, Dan Smiley, a descendent of the original owners, began '
         'keeping track of the plants and animals that lived in the area. He '
         'wrote meticulous notes on the backs of menus from the Mohonk '
         'Mountain House, a resort owned by his family.*\n'
         '“He would take these old menus—’cause he was green, he was an '
         'environmentalist—so he would cut up these menus into squares. And '
         'actually, on the back of all our index cards, you can see parts of '
         'the menu from back in the 1920s and 1930s, so you can see what was '
         'served for dinner that night.”\n'
         'Megan Napoli, a research ecologist with the Mohonk Preserve in New '
         'York. Smiley’s efforts produced a rare long-term data set of '
         'observations. It’s ideal for studying the impacts of climate change, '
         'which often play out over the course of many decades and cause '
         'subtle changes in the timing of natural processes. For instance, '
         'other research has shown that songbirds are migrating north earlier '
         'and earlier in the spring.\n'
         '“The reason that it’s important that the birds arrive at the proper '
         'time in the spring is because they need to time their arrival with '
         'the insect emergence. They need to be here to establish their '
         'territories, to establish their nesting sites, lay their eggs, and '
         'then once the egg hatch, and they have their nestlings, when the '
         'nestlings are in their nest, they need to time that with when the '
         'insects are most abundant.”\n'
         'Napoli has begun analyzing roughly 76,000 observations of songbird '
         'migration dates collected by Smiley and his team to see if they too '
         'show that climate change has altered the timing of migrations. Her '
         'preliminary results suggest that they do.\n'
         'Napoli found that short-distance migrants that spend their winters '
         'in the southern U.S. now arrive an average of 11 days earlier than '
         'they did in the 1930s. Long-distance migrants that overwinter in the '
         'tropics arrive roughly a week earlier. Napoli presented her results '
         'at a recent Ecological Society of America meeting in Portland, '
         'Oregon.\n'
         'As in previous studies, Napoli also found a correlation between '
         'early arrivals and rising spring temperatures at Mohonk, which the '
         'Smiley family has been tracking since 1896. But she says there are '
         'still more questions about how and why the birds are migrating '
         'earlier, and Smiley’s data may hold more clues.\n'
         'Meanwhile, who knows how many other long-term, personal data '
         'collections like Smiley’s are out there, waiting to be '
         'discovered—and to help bolster official attempts to track the '

 'text': 'In the 1800s, renowned explorer and naturalist Alexander von '
         'Humboldt observed a bizarre incident in the Amazon: he saw electric '
         'eels leaping into the air and shocking two horses. But some who '
         'heard the story thought Humboldt was a humbug: “Humboldt had '
         'described eels attacking horses…but people didn’t necessarily '
         'believe it.” Kenneth Catania, a professor of biological sciences at '
         'Vanderbilt University.\n'
         'But Humbolt was vindicated last year, when Catania published a study '
         'showing that electric eels indeed jump in the air to jolt potential '
         'predators. This maneuver is the most efficient way for an eel to '
         'deliver its shock. When the animal is submerged, electricity is lost '
         'to the water. By going airborne “the eel is essentially using that '
         'principle of physics to divert more and more current into the '
         'target.”\n'
         'But Catania still wanted to know more—like, exactly how strong is an '
         'eel’s shock to a human? To figure out the forces behind this '
         'electrifying leap, Catania used a relatively small eel and a human '
         'subject—himself.\n'
         '“I approached the eel with my hand in a container, which has a metal '
         'strip on it. And the eel decided it was concerned about whatever '
         'apparent creature might be coming near it…it came out of the water '
         'as I planned, up over the metal piece and onto my arm…that allowed '
         'me to measure the current flowing through my hand.”\n'
         'After taking various measurements and getting electrocuted 10 times '
         'by the eel, Catania discovered that even a small eel can deliver as '
         'much as 40 to 50 milliamps of electrical current. That’s more than '
         'enough to activate the pain receptors and withdrawal reflexes of '
         'horses, dogs and humans.\n'
         '“So I worked around horses when I was younger, and I backed into an '
         'electric fence a couple times. It’s a good analogy for what the eel '
         'is doing…and the animals learn not to touch the fence, and the eel '
         'teaches you not to touch the eel.”\n'
         'Catania’s new research is in the journal Current Biology. No pun '
         'intended. [Kenneth C. Catania, Power Transfer to a Human during an '
         'Electric Eel’s Shocking Leap]\n'
         '“It’s a really interesting behavior to be able to quantify, '
         'basically, what’s going on when the eel does this, because it’s a '
         'unique defense in the animal kingdom.” Plus, “This would basically '
         'give you a starting point to figure out what would go on with large '
         'electric eels in the Amazon.” Which, as Humboldt showed, are not '
         'horsing around.\n'

         'Phillips, astronomer at University of California Observatories. More '
         'photons, he says, basically means more science about incredibly '
         'faint, distant objects.\n'
         "And that's where the optics problem comes in. Because incoming light "
         'reflects off several mirrors before it comes out the business end of '
         "a telescope. And mirrors aren't perfectly reflective. The "
         'traditional mirror coating, aluminum, reflects only about 90 percent '
         'of light. Bounce that light around a few times in a telescope, and '
         'you lose valuable photons. \n'
         '"The throughput, the actual number of photons that are detected in '
         "the end in a modern spectrograph, you're doing good if you get "
         'thirty percent."\n'
         'So you want the most reflective material for your mirrors. Like '
         'silver, which reflects 97 to 99 percent of visible and infrared '
         "light, respectively. Big improvement over aluminum. But silver's got "
         'problems too. "It is finicky. It\'s subject to tarnish, and '
         'oxidation, and corrosion."\n'
         'So Phillips and his team have borrowed a trick from the computer '
         'industry, called atomic layer deposition. The technique allows them '
         'to take a silver-coated mirror—and coat it with extremely uniform '
         'layers of transparent aluminum oxide, to protect against '
         'corrosion. \n'
         'And unlike the small-scale atomic deposition used in the electronics '
         'industry, this new machine--recently installed in a lab at U.C. '
         'Santa Cruz—is scaled up to coat mirror segments up to a meter in '
         'diameter. Meaning you could coat all 500 mirrors of a '

         'oldest individual organisms on Earth. Many of them eke out a living '
         'in dry, rocky soils, on windblown ridgelines around 11,000 feet, in '

         'hemmed in by competing seedlings upslope, and hotter temperatures '
         'downslope. And that, Smithers says, would have long-lasting '
         'consequences. "You know, we talk about the effects of climate change '
         "happening on scales of 100 years. What's going to happen by 2100. "

         'Shadow profiles emerged as a potential problem in 2011 when an '

         'journal Science Advances raises the stakes.\n'
         'In that work, David Garcia, chair of systems design at the sci-tech '

         'to the museum staff that these shirts were not going to be good for '
         "research, and that's what I found.”\n"
         'In her trials, Putman wore tank tops of various colors—red, gray, '
         'light blue, dark blue—and then attempted to approach and capture '
         'western fence lizards in public and private parkland in L.A. And she '
         'found that when wearing dark blue, she could get twice as close to '

 'text': 'More than 900 years ago, the Pueblo people were thriving in New '
         'Mexico’s Chaco Canyon. While they were there, the region experienced '
         'what the whole country is looking forward to on August 21st: a total '
         'solar eclipse. Theirs took place in the year 1097—and they may have '
         'left a record of the event. \xa0\n'
         '“I spotted this very peculiar petroglyph, which was a round '
         'object.”\n'
         'Kim Malville is a retired Solar Astronomer from the University of '
         'Colorado Boulder. In 1992, he and colleagues were leading a field '
         'course in Chaco Canyon when he noticed a unique carving on the south '
         'side of a rock.\n'
         '“…which was a round object with loops coming out of it, and it '
         'struck me as maybe this was an image of the sun with the corona in a '
         'very active state. And maybe at that time, there is what is known as '
         'a coronal mass ejection.”\n'
         'That’s when a giant cloud of plasma spirals off the sun’s surface '
         'because of a solar flare. “It was somewhat foolhardy I suppose, on '
         'our part to suggest a particular explanation for it.” But Malville '
         'knew that he had a testable hypothesis.\n'
         'Astronomers knew that the region had a total solar eclipse on July '
         '11, 1097. During the brief darkness, the sun’s corona would have '
         'been visible. Solar activity increases and decreases on a roughly '
         '11-year cycle, so Malville used various historic records to find out '
         'what was happening in 1097.\n'
         '“And all of these indicated that in 1097, the sun was indeed in a '
         'state of very high activity and thus, we couldn’t prove that this '
         'was actually an image of the corona, but we could not falsify our '
         'hypothesis.” [José M. Vaquero and J. McKim Malville, On the Solar '
         'Corona Petroglyph in the Chaco Canyon, in Mediterranean Archaeology '
         'and Archaeometry, 2014]\n'
         'In another portion of Chaco Canyon, a pictograph high on an overhang '
         'has been interpreted as marking a supernova explosion in 1054. Below '
         'that, a pictograph may mark the sighting of Hailey’s Comet in 1066.\n'
         '“And all three of them may have played a role in intensifying '
         'people’s interest in the heavens and looking at the heavens very '
         'carefully.” \xa0\n'
         'Which is exactly what millions of current residents will be doing '
         'during this summer’s solar eclipse over North America.\n'

         'Well, if it’s any consolation, such rapid-onset boredom could '

         'study shows that the better your short-term memory, the faster you '
         'feel sated and decide you’ve had enough. The findings appear in the '
         'Journal of Consumer Research. [Noelle M. Nelson; Joseph P. Redden: '
         'Remembering Satiation: The Role of Working Memory in Satiation]\n'
         '“Though satiation can be physical, like when you feel full after '
         'eating too much, we were interested in the psychological side of '
         'satiation. Like when you’re just tired of something.”\n'

         'behavior at the University of Kansas School of Business. She and her '
         'colleague Joseph Redden at the University of Minnesota tried to '
         'think outside the lunch box. \n'
         '“Something that was interesting to me is that some people get tired '
         'of things at very different rates. When you think about pop songs on '
         'the radio, some people must still be enjoying them and requesting '
         'them even after hearing them a lot. But a lot of other people are '
         'really sick of those same songs.”\n'
         'The difference, the researchers posited, might have to do with '
         'memories of past consumption. For example, studies show that people '
         'push away from the dinner table sooner when they’re asked to '
         'describe in detail what they ate earlier for lunch.\n'
         'So the researchers tested the memory capacity of undergraduates. The '
         'students then viewed a repeating series of three classic '
         'paintings…like The Starry Night, American Gothic, and The Scream…or '
         'listened and re-listened to a series of three pop songs…or three '
         'pieces of classical music. Throughout the test, the participants '
         'were intermittently asked to rate their experience on a scale of '
         'zero to ten. \n'
         'And the better a participant scored in the memory test, the faster '
         'they got bored. \n'
         '“We found that people with larger capacities remembered more about '
         'the music or art, which led to them getting tired of the music or '
         'art more quickly. So remembering more details actually made the '
         'participants feel like they’d experienced the music or art more '
         'often.” \n'
         'The findings suggest that marketers could manipulate our desire for '
         'their products by figuring out ways to distract us and keep us from '
         'fully remembering our experiences. We could also trick ourselves '
         'into eating less junk food by immersing ourselves in the memory of a '
         'previous snack. \n'

         'Del Oro needed somewhere to dump their orange peels, and the company '

         'its forested land, it could dump orange peel waste on degraded '
         'pastureland within the conservation area.\n'
         "A thousand dump trucks' worth of orange peels were scattered on the "
         'land\xa0in 1998. "And within about six months the orange peels had '
         'been converted from orange peels into this thick black loamy soil. '

         'sludgy stuff filled with fly larvae."\n'

         'couldn\'t even find the site the first time I saw it." He couldn\'t '
         'find it because, over 16 years, the orange-peel waste had sent the '

         'how birds react to grazing can help conservationists figure out how '
         'to help those species most in jeopardy\n'
         'Ecologists from the Argentine Arid Zones Research Institute compared '
         "soil samples from the desert's Ñacuñán biosphere reserve to samples "

         "seeds—the birds' favorites—were just one quarter as likely to be "

         'Rufous-Collared Sparrow [sparrow sounds] had adjusted their diets, '
         'opting to dine on their less preferred options at the ranches, even '

 'text': 'We all know money can’t buy happiness. But according to a recent '
         'study, there may be a loophole. A team of researchers finds that '
         'shelling out for services that save time can bring greater feelings '
         'of life satisfaction than, say, simply buying more stuff. The '
         'results appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of '
         'Sciences. [Ashley V. Whillans et al., Buying time promotes '
         'happiness]\n'
         'It’s safe to say that most of us regularly feel crunched for time. '
         'So much so that we are experiencing what Ashley Whillans of the '
         'Harvard Business School, the lead author of the study, describes as '
         'a “time famine.” And like any famine, this chronic lack of time '
         'takes its toll on our health.\n'
         '“When we feel like our to-do lists are longer than the hours that we '
         'have time in the day to complete them, we can feel like our life is '
         'spiraling out of control, thereby undermining our personal '
         'well-being.”\n'
         'Well, if time is money, Whillans and her team wondered whether money '
         'that’s used to buy time could offer some relief. Like paying someone '
         'else to clean the house, mow the lawn, or deliver the groceries.\n'
         'To find out, the researchers asked more than 6,000 people from the '
         'U.S., Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands to rate their overall '
         'satisfaction with life, and to estimate how much money they lay out '
         'each month to outsource unenjoyable daily tasks or otherwise '
         'purchase some time off.\n'
         'And they found that respondents who willingly swap funds for free '
         'time also report feeling more content—regardless of their income or '
         'how many hours they work each week.\n'
         'To follow up, the researchers conducted a smaller experiment in '
         'which they gave volunteers forty bucks to buy a little something for '
         'themselves. The same participants got another forty dollars that '
         'they were told to spend on something that would save them time. And '
         'again, buying time was more likely to elevate mood and alleviate '
         'anxiety.\n'
         'These findings may be hard for some people to, well, buy:\n'
         '“Even in a sample of 850 millionaires, just over half of our '
         'respondents spent money to buy themselves time. These findings link '
         'to a broader literature suggesting that we do not always spend money '
         'in ways that promote happiness.”\n'
         'Even when we should know better.\n'
         '“Personally I know that when I recently moved to a new city I had a '
         'lot of errands to run. I had to let my own data convince me that '
         'buying time would make my life easier, less stressful and happier.”\n'

         'of Scorpius. That star was only seen for 14 days and then it '
         'disappeared and was never seen again."\n'
         'Michael Shara, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural '
         'History in New York. He’s spent more than two decades puzzling over '
         'this star that winked at astronomers nearly 600 years ago. "It\'s a '
         "many-sided jigsaw puzzle and I won't say we've filled in all the "
         "pieces, but at least I think we've got the corners and the "
         'boundaries pretty much in place now."\n'
         'What he and his colleagues have determined is this: the '
         '"disappearing star" the Korean astronomers spotted was in fact a '
         'massive explosion produced by a special type of binary star system, '
         "known as a 'cataclysmic variable.'\n"
         "The system consists of two stars. One's a white dwarf—“the corpse of "
         'something that used to be a star in the distant past." And its '
         'companion is a hydrogen-rich star, pretty much like our sun.\n'
         '"The white dwarf\'s gravity is so powerful it can suck hydrogen off '
         "of that companion. So in essence it's cannibalizing its companion "
         'hydrogen-rich star. That hydrogen flows into a ring around the white '
         'dwarf, and then every few months or few years the ring builds up, '
         'becomes more and more massive and collapses down onto the white '
         'dwarf. That gives rise to dwarf nova eruptions."\n'
         'But every couple of hundred thousand years, those dwarf eruptions '
         'are punctuated by much bigger bangs, as more and more hydrogen '
         'builds up. "You blow up as a gigantic hydrogen bomb, that\'s a '
         'thermonuclear event. And that classical nova is what happened in '
         '1437 to this star."\n'
         "Shara's team located the cosmic remains of that huge explosion. And "
         'they were able to determine that the nova of 1437—and smaller dwarf '
         'nova eruptions photographed in that same square of sky in the 1930s '
         "and '40s—were actually hiccups of light from the same binary star…in "
         'different phases of its life cycle.\n'
         '"And hence dwarf novae and old novae are the same things. Just like '
         'butterflies and caterpillars are the same things." The study is in '
         'the journal Nature. [M. M. Shara et al., Proper-motion age dating of '
         'the progeny of Nova Scorpii A.D. 1437]\n'
         'Shara says 50 of these novalike fireworks explode every year in the '
         'Milky Way…illuminating the galaxy, and perhaps, our understanding of '

         '“Rainer Weiss was born in 1932 in Berlin in Germany. He received his '
         'PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United '
         'States, and he is still affiliated with the M.I.T. as professor of '
         'physics. Dr. Weiss is since (sic) many years a U.S. citizen. Barry '
         'Barish was born in 1936 in Nebraska in the United States. He’s a '
         'professor of physics at Caltech, the California Institute of '
         'Technology. And finally, Kip Thorne was born in 1940 in Utah, in the '
         'U.S., and he’s currently professor of theoretical physics at '
         'Caltech.\n'
         '“And as I mentioned, all three Nobel laureates are members of the '
         'LIGO/Virgo collaboration, a large team of more than a thousand '
         'scientists who built and ran the detector that was used to discover '
         'gravitational waves. And with that, I’ll give the word to the '
         'chairman of the Nobel committee, Nils Mårtensson.”\n'
         '“On the 14th of September, 2015, the Laser Interferometer '
         'Gravitational Wave Observatory, LIGO, succeeded for the first time '
         'to directly observe gravitational waves. These waves were predicted '
         'by Einstein a hundred years ago, but until now they have escaped '
         'direct detection. This is a truly remarkable achievement, which '
         'crowns almost 50 years of experimental efforts by hundreds of '
         'scientists and engineers. And today the LIGO collaboration includes '
         'a thousand members from 90 institutions on five continents…we now '
         'witness the dawn of a new field: gravitational wave astronomy. This '
         'will teach us about the most violent processes in the universe and '
         'it will lead to new insights into the nature of extreme gravity.”\n'

 'text': 'Other rocky planets in our solar system show a common feature: '
         'within giant craters caused by impacts there’s evidence of volcanic '
         'activity. Which made scientists wonder—can big impacts actually '
         'cause volcanic eruptions? And has that scenario ever happened here? '
         'To find out, scientists went to one of the few massive craters on '
         'Earth not erased by plate tectonics: the Sudbury crater in Canada.\n'
         '“Sudbury is a 1.85-billion-year-old impact structure.”\n'
         'Teresa Ubide, a geochemist at the University of Queensland in '
         'Australia.\n'
         '“[Sudbury] was generated when a bolide of 10 to 15 kilometers in '
         'diameter hit Earth…and what happened was it obviously generated a '
         'large basin and also it melted the…crust on top of the Earth at that '
         'time. And generated a massive melt pool, 2.5 kilometers in depth.”\n'
         'But Ubide and her colleagues found that the impact did more than '
         'that: it also seems to have triggered eruptions of magma that came '
         'from deep in the mantle. The evidence lies in the fact that the '
         'chemistry of the lava that erupted at Sudbury changed over time. At '
         'first, it matched the surface rocks, suggesting it was just from '
         'local melting. But as the eruptions continued, the lava appeared to '
         'come from deep in the mantle, suggesting the impact stirred things '
         'up inside the Earth.\n'
         'No one knows yet exactly how the impact could have sparked a '
         'prolonged episode of volcanism. One possible explanation is that '
         'after the object smashed into the surface, the crust would have '
         'rebounded upward, temporarily decompressing the mostly solid mantle '
         'and causing it to melt and produce magma. The results are in the '
         'Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. [Teresa Ubide et al., '
         'Protracted volcanism after large impacts: Evidence from the Sudbury '
         'impact basin]\n'
         'It’s hard to know if the same thing happened on other planets, Ubide '
         'says. In many spots in the solar system it looks like volcanism '
         'happened much longer after the impact than what she saw at Sudbury. '
         'But without material to examine directly, we can’t be sure.\n'
         'Nevertheless, these results do help explain a mysterious chapter in '
         'Earth’s own history. Most major impacts on our planet happened about '
         'four billion years ago, when the solar system was still settling '
         'down. But there’s no crust around from that time, suggesting the '
         'entire planet got a makeover soon after.\n'
         '“We’re suggesting that impacts are able to not only generate the '
         'crater, but also, generate melting deeper, say, in the mantle, and '
         'bring to the surface material from depth. So actually, recycle and '
         'resurface.”\n'
         'It seems the pummeling that Earth endured in the beginning may have '
         'triggered volcanic activity that helped wipe away the evidence of '
         'those very impacts. In other words, our planet took a beating that '
         'may have accelerated its own recovery.\n'

         'gallons of water a year."\xa0\n'

         'The study also uncovered something these ecologists were not '

         'really closely related to affluence. So in L.A. that means wealthy '

         'But when researchers introduced Wolbachia into mosquitoes in the lab '
         'a decade ago, the bacteria bollixed the skeeters, making them unable '

         'Waldman is an aquatic conservation biologist at Queens College, who '
         'was on hand for the release.\n'
         '“They’re born in fresh water, they rear for the first year in '
         'freshwater then go to sea, spend a few years growing larger and then '
         'return to the river they were born in, much like salmon or sturgeon '
         'or shad. It’s called an anadromous life history. And this river '
         'appears to have a small relic run that never really expanded because '
         'it was limited by the habitat.\n'
         '“And now there’s a fish ladder on the first dam and these fish that '
         'are being stocked today, 400 alewives…and the idea here is that if '
         'they spawn in this section, the young will kind of imprint on this '
         'area, run downstream and then return when they’re old to spawn '
         'several years from now and want to go over the fish ladder.\n'
         '“In the meantime, several fish have used the fish ladder on their '
         'own this week that were from wild fish that were existing as a '
         'little relic stock, I believe, in this section of the river, so '
         'between the two I think the future looks very promising to have a '

         'there’s a series of dams above this first dam that are probably '

         'all online working, this little river that flows through the heart '

         'wild fish, but it also is a great tie to the ocean.\n'

         'only run on fuel oil or run on coal only run on the hottest days."\n'

         'across the eastern U.S., for every degree Celsius temperature rise, '

 'text': '“We’re hearing a lot of the arguments against action on reducing CO2 '
         'being based on, ‘well CO2 was higher in the past, so we don’t have '
         'to worry about it.’\n'
         'Gavin Foster, a geochemist at the University of Southampton. But '
         'Foster says that’s a flawed argument. For starters, just how far '
         'back in time do you have to look to find CO2 concentrations like '
         'what we expect to see in the future, and does it even make sense to '
         'compare the levels now and then?\n'
         'To answer these questions, Foster and his colleagues reconstructed '
         'the history of atmospheric carbon dioxide for the last 420 million '
         'years. They compiled roughly 1,500 estimates of CO2 concentrations '
         'from 112 previous studies. When the researchers combined these data, '
         'they found that atmospheric carbon dioxide went up and down over '
         'time, but that, in general, it gradually declined from almost 3,000 '
         'parts per million down to less than 300 parts per million before '
         'humans started burning fossil fuels.\n'
         'However, we have already started to reverse that trend. If we '
         'continue on a business-as-usual scenario, by the middle of this '
         'century, CO2 could reach levels not seen in 50 million years, '
         'according to Foster’s reconstruction. That’s long before humans '
         'evolved, back when the climate was much warmer and there were no '
         'large ice sheets at the poles. If we continue on that trajectory, by '
         'the year 2250, concentrations could approach what they were in the '
         'Triassic, 200 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\n'
         'But greenhouse gases aren’t the only factor impacting Earth’s '
         'climate. The sun also plays a major role. It’s grown brighter over '
         'time, offsetting most of the cooling related to dropping CO2 levels, '
         'Foster’s team found. And that fact has important implications for '
         'modern climate change. Because while we’re headed toward a world '
         'with CO2 levels similar to what they were in the distant geologic '
         'past, it won’t just be like rewinding the clock.\n'
         '“So, because the sun is now brighter than it was 200 million years '
         'ago, or 400 million years ago, that radiative forcing from CO2 in '
         'the future is going to be that much more potent. And that, we '
         'thought, was quite a strong message that hadn’t been noted before.”\n'

         'Foster stresses that this isn’t a vision of what will be, but what '
         'could be. “It’s more of cautionary note that, in the absence of any '
         'action, we will be entering a world quite rapidly—in the next 150 '
         'years—where the climate is receiving a magnitude of forcing that, as '

 'text': "If you've ever pulled a rolling suitcase through the airport, "
         "chances are you've also been annoyed by this common occurrence: the "
         'suitcase starts rocking back and forth on each wheel and finally '
         'tips over.\n'
         '"It\'s a very classic phenomenon in physics." Sylvain Courrech du '
         'Pont, a physicist at the University of Paris Diderot. "So if you '
         'perturb the system it goes very easily unstable. This is shared by '
         'many, many phenomena in nature." \n'
         'Courrech du Pont and his students wanted to get to the bottom of why '
         'luggage tips. So they built what looks like the skeleton of a '
         'wheeled suitcase, and then filmed it rolling on a treadmill. Then '
         'they modeled what they saw mathematically.\n'
         "And here's what they found. Under normal rolling conditions, the "
         "forward motion of the suitcase is perpendicular to the wheels' axis "
         'of rotation. All good. But when you hit a bump\xa0or jerk the '
         'handle, one wheel lifts up. All of a sudden the pulling motion is no '
         "longer perpendicular to the still-rolling wheel's rotation, and the "
         'wheel corrects that by drifting towards the center. But by that time '
         "the other wheel's coming down, same thing happens, and now the "
         'suitcase is really rocking.\n'
         '"And the first reaction you will have maybe is to slow down. But '
         "actually if you slow down you'll experience very big rocking "
         'oscillations." The way back to a smooth ride, he says, is to keep up '
         'your speed, or move even faster, once rocking begins. The study is '
         'in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A. [G. Facchini et al., The '
         'rolling suitcase instability: a coupling between translation and '
         'rotation]\n'
         'There are other solutions to suitcase instability—like doing a '
         'better packing job. "If you put heavy stuff close to the axis of '
         'symmetry, or close to the wheel axis, then it\'s stable, too." \n'
         'And Courrech du Pont has one more piece of advice to avoid rocking '
         'in the first place: "If you go slow enough it will always be '
         'stable." Keep that in mind, next time you\'re running to your gate.\n'

         'Saint Helens. But within days of the volcano erupting, the local '
         'ecosystem started to bounce back. Thanks to some unassuming little '
         'animals that spend lots of time underground.\n'
         '“The pocket gophers were the ecological heroes of Mount Saint '
         'Helens.”\n'
         'Emory University paleontologist and geologist Anthony J. Martin.\n'
         '“You normally don’t hear those words put together, pocket gopher and '
         'hero. But they were…these small burrowing mammals were able to '
         'survive this massive, devastating volcanic eruption.”\n'
         'Just as numerous animals that live underground have survived '
         'catastrophes and predators for hundreds of millions of years. As '
         'Martin discusses in his new book The Evolution Underground: Burrows, '
         'Bunkers, and the Marvelous Subterranean World Beneath Our Feet.\n'
         '“The reports I was reading about this, about how these researchers '
         'in helicopters are flying over the devastated landscape—just a few '
         'days later there were the burrow mounds. Pop pop pop. Thinking about '
         'these gophers that were below the ground. And they survived '
         'that....\n'
         '“So that to me was a golden opportunity to talk about that, as this '
         'incredible story of survival, but also renewal. That these little '
         'burrowing mammals brought back that landscape. Because their burrows '
         'served first of all as refuge for any other small animals that were '
         'there. So other small mammals and other vertebrates, such as '
         'amphibians and reptiles that lived there, they were either in their '
         'own burrows or they were in pocket gopher burrows or other small '
         'mammal burrows in the area.\n'
         '“The burrowing also brought up seeds. The seeds are already buried, '
         'so that caused plants to start sprouting in the area, where it '
         'wasn’t so much wind-blown seeds…then of course once other animals '
         'started coming back into the area, like elk, and they started '
         'dropping seeds through their feces and otherwise affecting the '
         'surface ecology, that then worked together to bring those ecosystems '
         'back to life. But the gophers were key in this. They really were '
         'essential for these ecosystems to be able to bounce back.”\n'
         'You can hear an extended interview with Martin about his book in a '
         'Science Talk podcast posted on our website. And there’s a children’s '
         'book just about the gophers and Mount Saint Helens called Gopher to '

 'text': 'Isaac Newton said, “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, '
         'but not the madness of people.” He meant that while people can be '
         'unpredictable, the planets are just the opposite—they glide through '
         'space in orbits defined by the laws of physics. But that view’s been '
         'changing and a new study bolsters a more complex outlook.\xa0\n'
         '“The big finding of this paper was the discovery of the first real '
         'firm, unambiguous geologic evidence to confirm this idea that the '
         'solar system is chaotic.”\n'
         'Stephen Meyers, a geoscientist at the University of '
         'Wisconsin–Madison.\n'
         'By chaotic, Meyers doesn’t mean that the planets zoom around wildly '
         'on random paths. Rather, he’s referring to the mathematical meaning '
         'of the word, in which the future state of a complex system depends '
         'strongly on its initial conditions. In this case, it means that '
         'seemingly random changes in planets’ orbits can occur because of '
         'subtle gravitational interactions between objects in the solar '
         'system.\n'
         '“It’s also known as the butterfly effect. This is the exact same '
         'phenomenon. The idea that a butterfly flapping over the Indian Ocean '
         'could influence weather patterns over North America a week later.”\n'
         'The idea has been proposed before, but Meyers and his team found '
         'supporting evidence in a surprising place: a rock formation in '
         'Colorado. The formation is made up of sedimentary layers deposited '
         'when a vast inland sea covered parts of North America. These layers '
         'contain a record of regularly paced climate changes that were '
         'triggered by fluctuations in the amount of sunlight hitting Earth as '
         'a result of variations in its orbit.\xa0\n'
         'For at least the last 50 million years or so, Earth’s orbit has '
         'cycled between a more circular shape and a more elliptical shape '
         'every 2.4 million years, producing climate changes with the same '
         'timing. However, by independently dating the rocks in Colorado with '
         'other methods, Meyers and his colleagues found that before about 85 '
         'million years ago, this cycle took 1.2 million years. The cycle time '
         'changed because Mars and Earth tugged on each other—just the kind of '
         'thing you would expect to see in a chaotic system. The findings are '
         'in the journal Nature. [Chao Ma, Stephen R. Meyers and Bradley B. '
         'Sageman, Theory of chaotic orbital variations confirmed by '
         'Cretaceous geological evidence]\n'
         'Meyers says the results have several implications. One is that they '
         'will help scientists to date ancient rocks and understand the link '
         'between orbital changes and climate. But the other potential '
         'implication is somewhat more disturbing: billions of years from now, '
         'there’s a very small chance that Mars could crash into Earth.\n'
         '“That certainly is a rather dramatic demise to the Earth that would '
         'be a consequence of the chaos.”\n'

         'others’ associates and make use of that intel when it comes time for '
         'payback. The findings are in the Royal Society journal Open Science. '
         '[Barbara Tiddi et al., Acquisition and functional consequences of '
         'social knowledge in macaques]\n'
         'Researchers were interested in the question of how primates suss out '
         'social relationships, knowledge that can come in handy for '
         'maneuvering within a complex society. To assess how the macaques '
         'obtain and make use of such social know-how, the researchers decided '
         'to focus on episodes of aggression—a common feature of simian '
         'interactions.\n'
         'They went through more than 500 hours of video recordings showing '
         'the exchanges that took place in a group of 57 macaques living in '
         'the Rome Zoo—monkeys whose genealogical relationships are well '
         'known. And they parsed some 15,000 episodes of aggression, noting '
         'the relationships among the individuals involved.\n'
         'First, they confirmed that monkeys that find themselves at the '
         'receiving end of aggression tend to turn around and take it out on a '
         'third party. And that retaliation is often directed at a relative of '
         'the original aggressor.\n'
         'But how do the monkeys determine who’s kin? Well, one way would be '
         'that they’ve been around long enough to have watched each other grow '
         'up. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. When researchers looked '
         'specifically at conflicts involving older monkeys, it didn’t seem '
         'that relatives were singled out for revenge.\n'
         'What does seem to be true is that victims will target their '
         'attacker’s associates—the other monkeys he hangs around with. If '
         'they’re not his relatives, they’re probably his cronies. So, close '
         'enough.\n'
         'Interestingly, there’s a benefit to hitting family members when '
         'you’re meting out justice. Macaques that sought out the kin of the '
         'monkeys they wanted to settle a score with were less likely to be '
         'picked on again in the future. Whereas wailing on the friends '
         'appeared to offer only present satisfaction, but no such future '
         'protection.\n'
         'Which suggests if you’re gonna beat on someone for payback, it '

         "today. It's called The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the "
         'Action of Worms. And earthworms were a passion: he wrote about their '
         'habits, their soil-tilling abilities, and even kept pots of '
         'worm-filled soil in his study.\xa0\n'
         'But his fascination was met with ridicule by some. "There\'s a '
         'famous cartoon where Darwin as an old man is in the middle. He '
         'evolves from monkeys and the monkeys evolved from earthworms."\xa0\n'

         "love earthworms, earthworms are brilliant. They're our friends, "
         'they\'re really important."\n'
         'One particularly interesting group of worms, he says, are the '
         'so-called "anecic" worms: the deep soil dwellers. "They live all '
         'their life in a single vertical channel in the soil. And at night '
         'they surface," looking for food—manure, straw, stuff like that, "and '
         'they pull it into their channels."\n'
         "They're big boys. Which makes them especially vulnerable to the "
         'plow. "Because they\'re so big, so they\'re chopped, exposed to '
         'birds, and their channels are destroyed."\xa0\n'
         'Schmidt and his colleague Maria Briones analyzed the relationship '
         'between tilling and the health of a dozen species of earthworms. '
         "They looked at 65 years'-worth of farm field studies, spanning the "
         'globe.\n'
         'And they found that in heavily plowed fields, half the earthworms '
         'had disappeared. But when farmers switched to no-till or '
         'conservation agriculture, worm populations wriggled back to normal '
         'numbers after about a decade. The study is in the journal Global '
         'Change Biology. [Maria J. I. Briones, Olaf Schmidt, Conventional '
         'tillage decreases the abundance and biomass of earthworms and alters '
         'their community structure in a global meta-analysis]\n'
         '"The plow," Darwin wrote, "is one of the most ancient and most '
         "valuable of man's inventions; but long before he existed the land "
         'was in fact regularly plowed, and still continues to be thus plowed '
         'by earthworms." And, Schmidt says, just as the worms look after the '
         'soil, the flip side\'s true, too. "If you look after the soil, you '
         'also look after the earthworms. So it is a good-news story."\n'

         'the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston.\n'
         '“We developed a few models in mice, which feature this exact pattern '

         'successful dieting. And what we found was that the one important '
         'determinant which drives this exaggerated weight regain tendency is '
         'a persistent alteration of the composition and function of our gut '
         'microbiome following a successful dieting. In other words, we diet '
         'and we normalize all of our metabolic parameters after we '
         'successfully diet…”\n'

         'coverage of the research often focused on the idea that spiders '

         'overwhelming majority of spiders is other arthropods, mostly insects '
         'and another type of tiny critter called springtails.\n'
         'Anyway, the study—which never mentions spiders eating all the '
         'world’s people—was done by Martin\xa0Nyffeler at the University of '
         'Basil in Switzerland and Klaus\xa0Birkhofer of Lund University and '
         'Germany’s Brandenburg University of Technology. [Martin\xa0Nyffeler '

         'Places with plenty of spiders. Because most places are places with '
         'plenty of spiders. The write-up the April issue of the journal The '
         'Science of Nature concluded that the world’s spider population '
         'weighs some 25 million tons. Now, your average spider only weighs an '
         'itty-bit, so if you do the calculation you get a total worldwide '
         'population of some eleventy gazillion spiders. More or less. But the '
         '25 million tons of spiders is a real number, derived from other '
         'published studies, dating as far back as 1951.\n'
         'The researchers then estimated how much weight in food that much '
         'weight of spiders would need. And they also went through many other '
         'studies that had estimated how much spiders ate in particular '
         'habitats, ranging from tropical forests to farms. Once they crunched '
         'all those arthropods, the intrepid spider speculators reached their '
         'verdict: spiders snatch between 400 million and 800 million tons of '
         'meat annually.\n'
         'So if you see a spider—and there’s almost certainly a bunch in your '
         'home right now—you could stomp it. Or you could gently put it '
         'outside. Or you could wish it bon appétit! And leave it to dine on '

         'Rogers and her colleague Montgomery Slatkin analyzed the genome from '

         '“You can either hang out with a load of guppies, and every time '

         '18th.\n'
         'In 2009 the National Academy of Sciences issued a report critical of '
         'a lot of the forensic evidence in the courtroom.\n'
         '“Most fundamentally…the report said that what was really lacking was '
         'testing and research. And thus they questioned whether any of this '
         'could be called science and they also questioned whether it was '
         'really that accurate…\n'
         'But forensic evidence is still widely admitted, even when the '
         'science behind it may be lacking.\n'

         'evidence…and that is still the feeling…that, eh, it’s still better '
         'than nothing, it’s still useful evidence, it has some degree of '
         'objectivity that’s not present in much lay testimony. And therefore '
         'it is useful. The problem of course is it comes heralded as science, '
         'and that gives it a weight that is probably disproportionate.\n'
         'I had a case, this was before the National Academy report, but it’s '

         '“What we found, first, was that Google…searches for sex on '

         'the world, what we saw is that each country has a particular '
         'signature with peaks and valleys of interest in sexual content.”\n'
         'Sá says that those patterns were most similar for countries that '
         'shared a similar culture…\n'
         '“This means that if you live in a culturally Christian country, '

         'Now, if you’re still wondering what’s so special about these '
         'holidays…Rocha says interest in sex coincides with a particular '
         'mood…a finding he made with the help of Twitter.\n'
         '“We collected close to 50 billion tweets and showed that, '
         'independently of the geography and independently of the particular '
         'culture, when we observed the surge of interest in sex we also '
         'observe the appearance of a particular mood that can best be '

         'around Christmas for Christian countries and maximized at the end of '

 'text': 'In 2013, a rare September storm swept across the plains of Colorado. '
         'When it hit the Rockies, it dropped more than a foot of rain in '
         'places like Boulder—as much as the city sees in an entire year. The '
         'rain unleashed deadly floods and landslides that swept away roads '
         'and buildings. In fact, a new study found that a century’s worth of '
         'erosion and sedimentation took place in a matter of a few days.\n'
         '“Once the flooding started, it happened quickly, and took a lot of '
         'people unawares.”\n'
         'Sara Rathburn, a geoscientist at Colorado State University in Fort '
         'Collins who experienced the storm herself. On top of the damage to '
         'manmade structures, Rathburn knew that the floods moved huge amounts '
         'of sediment, wood, and the organic carbon they contain. She saw a '
         'unique opportunity to put hard numbers on what went where: At the '
         'base of one of the watersheds that flooded, a reservoir captured '
         'everything that flowed downhill.\n'
         '“I was thinking about being able to track the sediment from the '
         'source to what I’m calling this anthropogenic sink—the reservoir—and '
         'really quantify it. We don’t have a lot of control on absolutely '
         'capturing everything that these large storms produce…and so the fact '
         'that the reservoir was capturing everything really seemed like a '
         'unique opportunity.”\n'
         'So Rathburn and her colleagues got a Rapid Response Research grant '
         'from the National Science Foundation to study what happened. The '
         'team compared detailed maps of the landscape and the lakebed before '
         'and after the storm, then they quantified the difference. They found '
         'that half a million cubic yards of sediment washed downstream during '
         'the storm, a volume that would normally take up to 115 years to '
         'erode. About 60 percent of it accumulated in the reservoir, taking '
         'up 2 percent of its storage space.\xa0\n'
         'The rest of the material was deposited partway down the river, where '
         'it will continue to be released into the reservoir for years to '
         'come, Rathburn says, causing ongoing headaches for dam managers…who '
         'are also worried about large logs clogging the openings that they '
         'use to release water. The findings are in the journal Geology. [S. '
         'L. Rathburn et al., The fate of sediment, wood, and organic carbon '
         'eroded during an extreme flood, Colorado Front Range, USA]\n'
         'The storm was an extreme event. But Rathburn says such episodes are '
         'becoming more and more common.\xa0\n'
         '“I really do think it’s climate-change driven. And that it’s '
         'something that’s just absolutely worthy and necessary of our study '
         'and our investigation. It’s too risky to ignore, given what it means '
         'for people living in places where hazards occur, which is almost '

         'knots. "There are more than six billion different types of knots '
         'that have been tabulated by mathematicians. Six billion." David '
         'Leigh, a chemist at the University of Manchester in the U.K. \n'
         'The hard part, he says, is actually making them. "Just because I can '
         'see a knitted jumper doesn\'t mean I can actually make one." Because '
         'what Leigh and his colleagues are interested in, is tying molecular '
         'knots—using strands that are 10,000 times thinner than a human '
         'hair.\n'
         '"With a molecule you can\'t just grab hold of the ends and tie them '
         "like you would a shoelace. They're too small for that. Instead "
         "you've got to use chemistry to make the molecules fold themselves "
         'round into the precise way you need to form the knot." \n'
         'Continuing the shoelace analogy—remember when you were learning to '
         'tie your shoes, your mom or dad put a finger in the middle of the '
         'knot, to make it easier to tie? Leigh and his team did something '
         'similar, but used metal ions as the "fingers" to keep the knot tying '
         'organized. Then tiny molecular strands, just 192 atoms long, '
         'assembled themselves around the ions. \n'
         '"And then mum pulls her finger out—we extract the metal ions out—and '
         'you\'re left with just the knot at the end." The most complex '
         'molecular knot ever synthesized. The study is in the journal '

         'molecular world—like for stronger braided polymers—maybe a better '
         'Kevlar.\n'
         'After all, we do have six billion knots to choose from. "As every '

         'clever little critters are such masters of navigation that some can '

         'Biology. [Sebastian Schwarz et al, How Ants Use Vision When Homing '
         'Backward]\n'
         'Ants often travel long distances—well, for them—when they’re '
         'searching for food to bring back to their nests. And their built-in '
         'GPS appears to function just fine even when they wind up having to '
         'travel in reverse because they’re dragging a huge morsel. But how do '
         'these backward bugs know where they’re going?\xa0\n'
         'To find out, researchers went to Spain to mess with some desert '
         'ants. They found an active nest and surrounded it with barriers that '
         'forced the foraging ants to follow a particular path back home. Once '
         'the ants were familiar with the maze, the researchers would scoop '
         'them up…hand them a cookie crumb…and then put them back in a '
         'different location…one that required taking a 90 degree turn to get '
         'to the nest.\xa0\n'
         'What the researchers saw was that the ants that were carting a '
         'small, easy-to-carry crumb would dash forward with confidence and '
         'were able to hook a right and head on home. Presumably because they '
         'could see where they were going and recognized the route.\xa0\n'
         'But some of their nest-mates were given a cookie crumb so large that '
         'they had to travel aft-first, pulling their prize behind them. These '
         'ants would set off in the correct general direction. But those that '
         'stuck with going in reverse would miss the turnoff to the nest.\xa0\n'
         'Some of the rearward ants, however, stopped to get their bearings. '
         'They would drop the cookie and turn around to take a look at the '
         'landscape. This quick peek allowed the six-legged savants to reset '
         'their inner maps. So that after turning back around to grab their '
         'cookies they headed in the right direction, even going back-end '
         'first. \xa0\n'
         'The ants-in-reverse appear to use celestial cues…like the position '
         'of the sun…to keep them on the straight and narrow. When the '
         'researchers used a mirror to make it look like the sun was on the '
         'other side of the sky, the beleaguered backward ants would turn tail '
         'for the opposite direction.\xa0\n'
         'So ants integrate a lot of information…about local landmarks, the '

         'researchers note, of a person who really took Marie Antoinette’s '
         'advice to heart and ate only cake for two decades.\n'
         'The results? The sugar-fed flies lost about 7 percent of their '

         'in the region. But it has also helped supercharge these extreme '
         'events, which scientists say are tied to storms that spiral north '
         'out of the Atlantic.\n'
         '“These winds actually pick up a lot of heat and moisture.”\n'
         'Vladimir Alexeev, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska '
         'Fairbanks.\xa0\n'
         '“And the atmosphere carries all this extra moisture and heat to the '
         'central Arctic, which results in [a] warmer and moister '
         'atmosphere.”\xa0\n'
         'Which then warms the surface.\n'
         'Alexeev says the heat ferried north by these storms helps slow the '
         'growth of sea ice in winter—causing it to be about 15 centimeters '
         'thinner by the end of the season. And thinner ice may have a harder '
         'time surviving the summer.\n'
         'But while the impact of these storms has grown in recent decades, '
         'the storms themselves are not happening more often, Alexeev says.\n'
         '“An important piece of information is that the frequency of those '
         'storms is not changing. What’s changing is the area of open water in '
         'those regions.”\n'
         'As the Atlantic Ocean has warmed up, the amount of sea ice around '
         'Scandinavia and Siberia in winter has decreased. So now, instead of '
         'passing over an ice-capped ocean, storms blow over larger areas of '
         'open water on their way north. And that gives them a chance to pick '
         'up more heat and moisture from the sea that they carry into the '
         'Arctic, causing stronger heat waves.\n'
         'Alexeev presented his results in December at the Fall Meeting of the '
         'American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. [Vladimir A Alexeev, '
         'Warming in the Nordic Seas, North Atlantic Frankenstorms and '
         'thinning Arctic sea ice]\n'
         'Another study by Kent Moore, an atmospheric physicist at the '
         'University of Toronto, came out around the same time as the meeting '
         'and also linked the heat waves to storms passing over more and more '
         'open water. That research is in the journal Scientific Reports. [G. '
         'W. K. Moore , The December 2015 North Pole Warming Event and the '
         'Increasing Occurrence of Such Events]\n'
         'Alexeev says the situation could be an example of what scientists '
         'call a positive feedback: warming causes the loss of sea ice, which '
         'promotes more warming and even more ice loss. In other words, it’s a '
         'snowball effect—or in this case, an anti-snowball effect.\n'

         "heating up in the sun. But it doesn't actively cool them.\xa0\n"
         "To understand why, consider what the white paint does. Here's how "
         'optical scientist Xiaobo Yin of the University of Colorado describes '
         'it: "It\'s a mirror for the sunlight, it\'s also a mirror for the '

         'The coating reflects 96 percent of solar radiation—a slight '

         'different species express different groups of these seven genes."\n'
         'Biologist Daniel Escobar-Camacho, from the University of Maryland in '

         'violet, blue, blue-green, green, light green, and red."\xa0\n'
         'But selection pressure has kept only some of those genes intact.\n'
         'African cichlids, whose visual systems are well studied, evolved in '
         'fairly clear, calm, blue lakes with plenty of sunlight. And it was '
         'known that they’ve maintained the genes for seeing short wavelength '

         "and some have even lost two. But they've each lost different "
         'genes.\xa0\n'
         '“What is interesting is that they are expressing genes in the retina '

         'concordance with the light environment in Amazon waters, because '
         'Amazon waters transmit long wavelengths best.”\n'
         'In other words, Amazonian cichlids were most sensitive to red and '

         'that leads to intense flulike symptoms. Yet the extraordinarily high '
         'response rate puts Kymriah in the very small category of truly '
         'transformative treatments.\n'
         'Scientific American spoke with Jimenez about CAR-T therapy, his '
         'hopes for new game-changing treatments that could target '
         'disease-causing proteins and problems with the U.S. health care '
         'system.\n'
         '[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n'
         'Do you think CAR-T immune therapies like Kymriah may ever be useful '
         'beyond blood cancers?\r\n'
         'We have mixed views at the company about that. Some [of us] believe '
         'that we will find a way to impact solid tumors, particularly in '
         'combination with other drugs. Right now we’re very confident in the '
         'technology for different blood cancers but we’re still in the '
         'proof-of-concept stages for solid tumors.\n'
         'What made you pursue CAR-T, even as other large pharmaceutical '
         'companies decided not to bet on the technology?\r\n'
         'Novartis was known for breakthrough innovations in oncology back in '
         'the early 2000s. We developed Gleevec [which treats certain types of '
         'blood and intestinal cancers with less collateral damage to healthy '
         'cells than a typical chemotherapy]. When we saw the data on CTL019 '
         'CAR-T coming out of Penn—the really early data about five years '
         'ago—we decided that this was a place where we were going to place a '
         'big bet. The data reminded us of the early days of Gleevec, and so '
         'we went out on a limb.\n'
         'Why is Novartis able to invest in such a long-term gamble while '
         'other companies aren’t?\r\n'
         'We’re a Swiss company, which makes us a little bit more insulated '
         'from the quarter-to-quarter pressures that some of the other '
         'pharmaceutical companies feel. We have a longer-term view and we '
         'have an investor base that is perhaps more patient than some others, '
         'so that gives us the ability to invest for the long term.\n'
         'Is there another gamble like that in the works now?\r\n'
         'There’s a new technology that Jay Bradner, the head of our research '
         'organization, is championing: protein degradation [essentially '
         'tricking the body into disposing of harmful proteins], which is a '
         'new approach to addressing intractable [disease] targets. We’re also '
         'investing heavily in gene editing because we do believe there will '
         'be therapeutic value coming out of gene editing.\n'
         'How confident are you that CRISPR will be usable to edit genes in '
         'sick people?\r\n'
         'So far it’s promising, but I think everybody is in a wait-and-see '
         'mode. There will be twists and turns along the path, as there is '
         'with any new technology.\n'
         'After more than a decade working for a European drug company, have '
         'you come up with any ideas for fixing America’s health care '
         'system?\r\n'
         'Obviously, the current system is not sustainable. I really believe '
         'that the only way it’s going to shift is if we shift away from this '
         'transactional approach of selling pills or fee-for-service towards '
         'an outcomes-based one, where we get paid for the results that we '
         'deliver. If you were to say, “We’re only going to get paid based on '
         'the outcome we deliver,” you could eliminate a lot of the waste in '
         'the system.\n'
         'Do you have a solution for the high cost of drugs?\r\n'
         'A pharmaceutical company gets 60 percent of the dollar that is paid '
         'for the drug. Forty percent goes to the supply chain: the pharmacy '
         'benefit manager, the wholesaler, the retailer. That seems wrong. '
         'We’re the ones taking all the risk. We’re the ones developing the '
         'drug. That 40 percent—how do we find a way to get [some of] that '
         'money into the hands of the patient at the pharmacy benefit counter? '
         'If we can do that, we can put a serious dent in pharma costs in the '
         'U.S.\n'
         'So, you’re saying drug costs could come down by cutting the money '
         'made by insurance companies and retailers? How do you make that '
         'happen?\r\n'
         'Most Medicare patients are on fixed incomes, and when they go to the '
         'pharmacy counter they’re not able to get any kind of co-pay '
         'assistance. One way we could help these seniors that are seeing big '
         'increases in either deductibles or co-pays is to help them with that '
         'out-of-pocket expense. There is a legislative and regulatory '
         'approach that we’re working on to try to effect that.\n'
         'What’s next for you? Will you be starting a company, or joining '
         'one?\r\n'
         'I haven’t decided if I want to do a portfolio of companies and be on '
         'the investing side—helping these companies get formed and started—or '
         'whether I want to enter an early-stage company and actually operate '
         'it.\n',

         'loss, persecution by farmers, and invasive diseases. In the '

         'once again hear the calls of more than one hundred Hawaiian crows – '
         "or 'alalā, as it is called there – but only in aviaries.\n"

         'Researchers once focused their efforts primarily on breeding and '

         '"And now that they are doing so well, and it\'s at the point where '
         'they could be in the wild again, now we can look at their '
         'vocalizations and their behaviors and things like that."\xa0\n'
         'University of Hawaii bioacoustics researcher Ann Tanimoto. Those '
         'other aspects—culture, if you will—are critical for a species as '
         "socially complex as the 'alalā.\n"
         "Tanimoto and her team made recordings of captive-bred 'alalā pairs "

         'compared them to recordings made in the early 1990s by Fish and '

         'wild, are more innate, so basically naturally inside of them. And '
         'those that differ are socially learned by being passed on generation '

         'of these areas of depleted oxygen. As a result they end up kind of '
         'aggregating on the edges. They kind of line up outside the '
         "deoxygenated waters. And that's why I call it the burning building "

         'Fishermen flock to where those shrimp "take a breath." And shrimp '
         'get caught earlier in the season. So combine these two '

         'infection peaks. Winter is the time period in which white nose '
         'syndrome is happening to bats."\n'
         'To understand how the New York bats were surviving, Langwig and her '

         'as well as in areas where the fungus is established, bats become '
         'infected at the same time. And then in both places we see the fungus '
         'begin to grow and start to increase. However in areas where the '

         'stimulate the mammary gland while they suckle, so they eventually '
         'starve from a lack of nutrition.\n'
         'But it turns out that vigorous stimulation of one mammary gland can '

         '150 piglets. Twenty-three of them were classified as weaklings, '
         'which meant they weighed less than one kilogram at birth or they '
         'died before weaning. Then he looked to see what differentiated the '
         'weaklings that survived from those that died.\n'
         'And indeed, those weaklings that survived were more likely to nurse '
         'next to their strongest brothers and sisters. "Weaklings, which are '
         'limited in terms of mammary gland stimulation, actually take '
         'advantage of strong stimulation implemented by their heavier '

         'Skok says that pig breeders commonly sort piglets into different '
         'weight classes, so the heaviest babies nurse together with one '

 'name': 'Instead of Filling Cavities, Dentists May Soon Regenerate Teeth',
 'text': 'For dentists, a cavity is a conundrum—in order to save the tooth '
         'they must further damage it. Currently, the primary way to treat a '
         'cavity is to excavate the decay and the surrounding area before '
         'filling the resulting crater with a durable surrogate material such '
         'as metal, plastic or glass cement.\n'
         'But what if instead of drilling holes into teeth and patching them '
         'up with synthetic fillers, dentists could coax our pearly whites to '
         'regrow themselves? Recently, Paul Sharpe, a bioengineer at King’s '
         'College London, and his colleagues discovered a new way to do '
         'exactly this in mice. Last year they published a study describing '
         'their innovative techniques in Scientific Reports. And since then '
         'they have made even more progress that edges this experimental '
         'procedure closer to human clinical trials. If the treatment '
         'eventually becomes part of the dentist’s standard tool kit, '
         'scientists say it would easily be one of the field’s most important '
         'advances in 50 years.\n'
         'Our teeth get damaged all the time. Most of the injuries they endure '
         'are due to everyday wear and tear as well as the activity of '
         'microbes in the mouth. These organisms coat the surface of each '
         'tooth and feed on meal remnants. As they break down particles of '
         'food, some of these microbes produce and secrete acids as a '
         'by-product. And that acidity degrades enamel—the tooth’s hard outer '
         'layer.\n'
         'Like skin, teeth can usually repair minor mishaps themselves. When '
         'our teeth remain uncleaned for too long, however, acid can eat '
         'through the enamel and begin dissolving underlying layers of dense, '
         'bony tissue called dentin. When dentin is seriously injured, stem '
         "cells located in the tooth's soft, innermost layer—the dental "
         'pulp—morph into cells called odontoblasts, which secrete new tissue. '
         '(Stem cells are capable of becoming virtually any type of cell.) Yet '
         'when the injury is too large or deep, that fresh dentin is not '
         'sufficient to restore the tooth. The result is often a cavity.\n'
         'Sharpe suspected he could dramatically boost teeth’s natural healing '
         'ability by mobilizing stem cells in the dental pulp. Earlier '
         'research had demonstrated the Wnt signaling pathway—a particular '
         'cascade of molecules involved in cell-to-cell communication—is '
         'essential for tissue repair and stem cell development in many parts '
         'of the body such as the skin, intestines and brain. Sharpe wondered: '
         'Could this signaling pathway also be important for self-repair '
         'processes in teeth? If so, maybe exposing damaged teeth to drugs '
         'that stimulate Wnt signaling would similarly encourage the activity '
         'of stem cells in the dental pulp—giving teeth the kind of '
         'regenerative superpowers usually seen only in plants, salamanders '
         'and starfish.\n'
         'To test this idea, Sharpe and his fellow researchers drilled holes '
         'into the molars of mice, mimicking cavities. They then soaked tiny '
         'collagen sponges (which are made from the same protein found in '
         'dentin) in various drugs known to stimulate Wnt signaling, including '
         'tideglusib, a compound that has been investigated in clinical trials '
         "for its potential to treat Alzheimer's and other neurological "
         'disorders. The scientists then placed these drug-soaked sponges in '
         'the drilled mouse molars, sealed them up and left them for four to '
         'six weeks. The teeth treated with these drugs produced significantly '
         'more dentin than ones untreated or stuffed with an unsoaked sponge '
         'or typical dental fillers. In most cases the technique restored the '
         'rodents’ pearly whites to their former intact state. “It was '
         'essentially a complete repair,” Sharpe says. “You can barely see the '
         'joint where the old and new dentin meet. This could eventually be '
         'the first routine pharmaceutical treatment in dentistry.”\n'
         'David Mooney, a professor or bioengineering at Harvard University '
         'who has also investigated new ways to heal teeth but was not '
         'involved in the study, says he is “very impressed” by these '
         'findings. “This is not just scientifically important, but has '
         'significant practical advantages," he says. Adam Celiz, an assistant '
         'professor of bioengineering at Imperial College London who was also '
         'not involved in the recent research, says this is an important '
         'advance in the emerging field of regenerative dentistry. “The '
         'materials dentists use could soon be revolutionized,” he says.\n'
         "Any treatment that recruits the body's native stem cells or adds new "
         'stems cells to the body, however, poses a risk of uncontrolled '
         'tissue growth. Experimental and unregulated stem cell therapies have '
         'resulted in brain tumors, for example, as well as bones growing in '
         'eyelids. But in this case, Sharpe says, the amounts of drug used are '
         'so tiny that the risk of unwanted growth is minimal. Celiz agrees '
         'the danger is small but he says rigorous testing in lab animals and '
         'clinical trials should be done to rule out potential side effects.\n'
         'Since publishing their initial study Sharpe and his colleagues have '
         'tested their regenerative technique on rats. (Because those rodents '
         'have larger teeth than mice, a drilled rat molar better approximates '
         'human tooth decay.) The treatment worked just as well on the rats as '
         'it had on the mice, Sharpe says, but the data has not yet been '
         'published. Now Sharpe’s team is investigating a larger group of '
         'candidate drugs in order to determine whether another medication '
         'works better than those already tested, and to determine the optimal '
         'dose. They are also developing an alternative delivery system that '
         'is more amenable to modern dental practices: The chosen drug will be '
         'dissolved in a gel that is injected into a cavity and bathed with '
         'ultraviolet light to solidify it—a quick and easy procedure similar '
         'to one dentists already use to seal and repair teeth.\n'
         'In order to formally introduce this treatment to modern dentistry, '
         'however, the researchers will need to perform clinical trials with '
         'human patients. Such work is at least several years away, Sharpe '
         'says. But some of the drugs he might consider are already approved '
         'for other uses in humans, which he hopes could expedite the process '
         'for eventual approval. "A lot of dental treatments are still in the '
         'dark ages," Sharpe says. "It\'s time to move on."\n',

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'We Need a Universal Flu Vaccine before the Next Pandemic Strikes',
 'text': 'This year the world will mark the 100th anniversary of one of the '
         'most devastating infectious disease events in recorded history: the '
         '1918 influenza pandemic, which caused an estimated 50 million to 100 '
         'million deaths worldwide.\n'
         'There were several reasons for the awful toll. First, most people '
         'likely had no preexisting immune protection to the brand-new strain '
         'that had emerged. Second, this particular virus may have been '
         'unusually lethal. Third, crowding and poor sanitation allowed for '
         'rampant disease transmission, especially in regions where access to '
         'health care was limited. And finally, antiviral drugs and flu '
         'vaccines were still decades in the future.\n'
         'Over the past century we have made substantial advances in all these '
         'areas. But we are still unprepared for the inevitable appearance of '
         'a virus like the one that struck a century ago. Even an ordinary '
         'seasonal flu epidemic will still kill some 12,000 to 56,000 people '
         'every year in the U.S. alone. That is because seasonal viruses '
         'continually evolve, and although we update our vaccines frequently, '
         'they may be only 40 to 60 percent effective. Moreover, seasonal '
         'vaccines may provide little or no protection against pandemic flu. '
         'Pandemic viruses typically arise from a process referred to as an '
         'antigenic shift, in which the new virus acquires, usually from '
         'animal influenza viruses, one or more genes that are entirely novel '
         '(as seems to have happened in 1918, when all eight pandemic virus '
         'genes were novel).\n'
         'In the years since 1918, three influenza pandemics associated with '
         'antigenic shifts occurred: in 1957, 1968 and 2009. In each of these '
         'instances, however, the new viruses emerged via the mixing of animal '
         'influenza virus genes with those of the 1918-descended viruses '
         'already circulating in the human population, which meant that many '
         'people were at least partially immune. That, plus lower viral '
         'pathogenicity and improvements in public health infrastructure and '
         'medical treatment, is what probably led to less catastrophic '
         'pandemics.\n'
         'We must also tackle the issue of “prepandemic” influenza '
         'viruses—those that could potentially cause pandemics but that have '
         'not (yet) done so. Human infections with avian influenza viruses '
         'have occurred with increasing frequency over the past two decades. '
         'Prepandemic vaccines against various strains of H5N1 and H7N9 '
         'viruses have been developed and in some cases stockpiled; similar to '
         'seasonal influenza viruses, however, these avian strains are subject '
         'to antigenic drift within their avian hosts. Many of the H7N9 avian '
         'viruses that have jumped species from poultry to cause human '
         'infections in China in 2016 and 2017 have changed significantly from '
         '2013 avian strains. As a result, the human immune responses elicited '
         'by a vaccine developed against the 2013 H7N9 virus may not be '
         'effective against 2017 strains.\n'
         'The remarkable capacity of influenza viruses to undergo antigenic '
         'drift or shift to overcome and escape human population immunity '
         'leaves us vulnerable to a public health disaster potentially as '
         'serious as the 1918 pandemic. To meet this global health challenge, '
         'scientists are working to develop “universal influenza vaccines”—new '
         'types of inoculations that can provide protection not only against '
         'changing seasonal influenza viruses but also against the inevitable '
         'pandemic viruses that will emerge in the future.\n'
         'Recently the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases '
         'convened a workshop with leading experts in the influenza field to '
         'address the need for better influenza vaccines. Among many obstacles '
         'to developing a universal vaccine, the most formidable is our '
         'incomplete understanding of the immune responses that protect people '
         'against influenza, including the role of immunity at mucosal '
         'surfaces.\n'
         'One approach is to design a vaccine to generate antibody responses '
         'to parts of the virus that are common to all influenza strains and '
         'do not readily change by mutation. It is also crucial to clarify how '
         'other parts of the immune system work together with antibodies to '
         'protect against influenza. The hurdles in the development of such '
         'vaccines are daunting. But we are optimistic that we can apply '
         'existing tools and experimental strategies to meet the challenge. As '
         'we note the centennial of the 1918 flu pandemic, let us remind '
         'ourselves of the importance of this line of research in preventing a '
         'repeat of one of the most disastrous events in the history of global '
         'health.\n',

         '“The real questions have been: for how long was it warm, and what '
         'was the mechanism for warming it up.”\n'
         'James Kasting, a geologist at Penn State University. He shared his '
         'take on the problem at the December meeting of the American '
         'Geophysical Union in San Francisco, and in the journal Earth and '
         'Planetary Science Letters. [Natasha E. Batalha et al., Climate '
         'cycling on early Mars caused by the carbonate–silicate cycle]\n'
         'Some researchers have suggested that early Mars only thawed out when '
         'large asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions temporarily warmed the '
         'planet. But Kasting and others think warm windows from such dramatic '
         'events would have been too brief to carve the vast canyons that '
         'exist on Mars. Now, Kasting and his colleagues have come up with an '
         'alternative explanation: they think Mars may have experienced a '
         'series of climate cycles caused by changes in the strength of the '
         'greenhouse effect.\n'
         'The idea goes like this: when Mars was cold and frozen, volcanoes '
         'continued to belch out the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and '
         'hydrogen into the atmosphere. There, the gas blanket trapped heat '
         'and warmed the planet up until liquid water began to flow, forming '
         'Mars’ rivers and lakes. However, warm temperatures and abundant '
         'water would also have sped up certain chemical reactions that '
         'consumed carbon dioxide, reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling '
         'the planet back down again. Then the cycle would repeat.\n'
         '“Which is similar to what the impact people have been arguing, '
         'except that when it gets warm, it can stay warm for millions of '
         'years instead of thousands of years.”\n'
         'So far, Kasting’s team has only shown that such an explanation is '
         'possible, according to climate models. But the researchers say '
         'NASA’s Curiosity rover and other future Mars missions could help '
         'test the idea by looking for evidence of multiple warm events, and '
         'their durations. Perhaps, hidden in the dry Martian dust lie clues '

         'Møller, an evolutionary biologist at the French National Science '
         'Research Council. “So this ‘bird brain’ expression is a little bit '
         'simplified.” Some birds are so intelligent that they’re informally '
         'referred to as “primates with feathers.”\n'
         'But even among the smartest bird species, there’s still natural '
         'variation in brain size. Which is a big deal—when it comes to being '
         'hunted. Møller worked with a taxidermy shop in Denmark, which had '
         'data on nearly 4000 birds brought in to be stuffed since 1960. A lot '
         'of the birds were just found dead—hit a window or wire—and people '
         'picked them up. But 300 of the specimens had been hunted.\xa0\n'
         'So Møller’s team then compared the brain sizes of birds that got '
         'shot to those that didn’t. They controlled for the birds’ age, sex, '
         'body size, and species. And they found that the hunted specimens’ '
         'brains were actually five percent smaller, on average, than the '
         'brains of birds that died by other means. “The surprising thing is '
         'that, if you make a similar kind of analysis of liver or heart size, '
         'there is absolutely no difference there. So this is specific to the '
         'brain.” The results are in the journal Biology Letters. [Anders Pape '
         'Møller and Johannes Erritzøe, Brain size and the risk of getting '
         'shot]\xa0\n'
         'The researchers assume that individuals with larger brains had what '
         'they called “superior escape ability.” That is, they were better at '
         'not getting shot.\n'
         'As game season begins, Møller has this observation for hunters: '
         '“When you are sitting at the dinner table and eating the duck that '
         'you managed to shoot, with all likelihood it’s one with a '
         'disproportionately small brain.” Most certainly food for '

         'orca, who recently dropped from researchers’ radar and is (sadly) '

         'But why would a female whale stick around for so long after she’s '

         'significantly change the way your life unfolds."\xa0\n'
         'Problem is: that memorable advice looks suspect.\n'
         'Because several studies, with many more participants, have tried to '
         'replicate the original results, and failed. The most recent attempt '
         'involved 247 male college students—nearly six times more volunteers '
         'than were in the original study. And the new study found that '
         'holding poses—dominant or otherwise—had no significant effect on '

 'fileType': 'article',
 'name': 'How to Understand, and Help, the Vaccine Doubters',
 'text': 'We are in the golden age for vaccines. We have dozens of highly '
         'effective vaccines licensed for infectious disease, promising new '
         'technologies contributing to massive advancement of vaccine '
         'development, and several promising vaccines on the horizon. '
         'Unfortunately, vaccines have been a victim of their own success. '
         'With the drastic reduction of once-devastating diseases like '
         'whooping cough and measles, it seems like some parents think that '
         'the vaccines themselves are the new danger. But the threat isn’t '
         'gone; it’s been kept at bay by vaccinations. With clusters of '
         'vaccine-hesitant individuals especially worrisome, we need to find '
         'effective ways to convince people that the true danger is still '
         'disease.\n'
         'Concerns about the chemical components of vaccines, government '
         'mandates of vaccinations for school entry, and “Big Pharma” pushing '
         'vaccination seem unchanged when facts countering these claims are '
         'presented. Most of the existing research focuses on providing '
         'education or addressing parental vaccine attitudes, but rarely '
         'addresses the values people hold. We know that a host of factors '
         'influence how people retain and use facts in their decision-making, '
         'and most of us don’t make our decisions rooted in emotionless logic. '
         'But if the facts alone don’t work, then what does?\n'
         'Perhaps we haven’t been looking in the right place. Recently, the '
         'focus has been on educational interventions, appeals to altruism, '
         'and statistics, when the answer may lie in an unexpected place, like '
         'political science and social psychology. We suspected that '
         'individual values might hold the key – after all, there’s a reason '
         'that many politicians will appeal to their voters’ values – so we '
         'sought to determine if there is a relationship between values and '
         'vaccine hesitancy. We found a link between vaccine hesitancy and '
         'values of purity and liberty, which is especially informative given '
         'that many “traditional” pro-vaccine arguments focus on other values: '
         'fairness and protecting oneself and others from harm. Perhaps, if we '
         'incorporate these additional values into pro-vaccine messages, '
         'they’ll resonate more with hesitant parents and be more effective at '
         'convincing people to get vaccinated.\n'
         'So, what are these values, and what do they mean? We used a '
         'framework known as Moral Foundations Theory, a relatively recent '
         'development in social psychology that can be used to describe the '
         'moral palate. Multiple broad values – authority, care, fairness, '
         'liberty, loyalty, and purity – guide our intuitions as we make snap '
         'judgements about whether something is right or wrong. Not everyone '
         'uses these values in the same way. Just as some people respond more '
         'to sweet than salty flavors, so too do some individuals prioritize '
         'certain foundations over others. The scores an individual receives '
         'on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire reflect the strength of their '
         'emphasis on particular foundations; the higher the score, the larger '
         'of a consideration it is in their decisions. \xa0\n'
         'In our first study, our team at Emory recruited over one thousand '
         'participants online and asked them questions about their vaccine '
         'attitudes and their endorsement of the moral foundations. Vaccine '
         'attitudes were measured using the Parent Attitudes about Childhood '
         'Vaccines short scale, a standardized assessment method. We found '
         'that parents with moderate vaccine concerns scored similarly to '
         'their less-concerned counterparts on all foundations except purity. '
         'Moderately concerned parents were twice as likely to have a high '
         'purity score. Compared to parents with the lowest hesitancy, parents '
         'in the highest category were twice as likely to have high scores for '
         'both purity and liberty, and twice as likely to have a low score for '
         'authority. Essentially, hesitant parents are more likely to strongly '
         'emphasize values of purity and liberty, and less likely to strongly '
         'emphasize values of authority, than non-hesitant parents.\n'
         'Our colleagues at Loyola (Cara Ray, Kala Melchiori, and Jeff '
         'Huntsinger) suspected that common claims on anti-vaccination '
         'websites, like “Vaccines contain poisons/toxins/contaminants” and '
         '“Vaccine mandates are excessive government control” might especially '
         'resonate with hesitant parents because they stimulate these purity '
         'and liberty values. In a second study, we asked parents to rate '
         'their strength of belief in vaccine claims themed around both purity '
         'and liberty, which were adapted from the claims we commonly saw on '
         'anti-vaccination websites. This second study not only replicated the '
         'first study’s purity and liberty findings, but also demonstrated '
         'that high scores for these two foundations were linked with stronger '
         'belief in these purity- and liberty-themed vaccine claims. This '
         'suggests that stronger endorsement on these foundations may make '
         'individuals more likely to believe claims that resonate with these '
         'values, even if the claims themselves are factually inaccurate.\n'
         'While these findings might provide a potential mechanism for vaccine '
         'attitude formation and change, it’s important to note that our '
         'results are correlational, not causal. Moreover, accurately '
         'identifying a phenomenon doesn’t automatically translate to '
         'successful interventions. All the same, these findings suggest that '
         'current messages promoting vaccination – which overwhelmingly tend '
         'to concentrate on care/harm and in some cases fairness – may not be '
         'targeting the most salient moral concerns among vaccine-hesitant '
         'parents. This could open up a new avenue for pro-vaccination '
         'messaging to incorporate purity and liberty values. \xa0If we can '
         'better connect with concerned parents, they might be more receptive '
         'to hearing what we have to say. What if other healthcare decisions '
         'and attitudes, like those about palliative care or testing for '
         'sexually transmitted diseases, are also associated with moral '
         'foundations? How can we leverage such associations to promote '
         'overall public health? We are eager to learn the answers.\n',

         'those big ones are rare and the link seems to break down for smaller '
         'events.\n'
         'So the researchers crunched a bunch of numbers: by looking at more '
         'than 10,000 medium and large earthquakes, they found that the '
         'proportion of large events increased when tidal stress was high.\n'
         'The results do not imply that every full or new moon will bring an '

         'earthquakes. It starts similarly, but it grows at some probability '
         'to large scale. That probability is controlled by some other '
         'effect.”\n'
         'And one of those effects might be the tides. Ide points out that '

         'of slow deformation unlocks very small part of the fault…so it '

         'Genetics. [Soheil Baharian et al, The Great Migration and '
         'African-American Genomic Diversity]\n'
         'To estimate patterns of ancestry, researchers analyzed genetic data '
         'from nearly four thousand African-Americans who had participated in '
         'three medical studies.\n'
         'Their findings confirmed historical records—genetic evidence showed '
         'that female slaves often gave birth to children fathered by white '
         'slaveowners. The genetic analysis found that 82.1 percent of the '
         'average African-American’s ancestors came from Africa, while 16.7 '
         'percent were Europeans and 1.2 percent were Native American.\n'
         'The team also could date when particular genes entered the mix. '
         'Native American genes were introduced into the typical '
         'African-American genome in the early 1600’s. Genes from Europeans '
         'were for the most part introduced in the decades before and during '
         'the Civil War.\n'
         'Researchers also found those still living in the southern United '
         'States have a greater percentage of African ancestry than those in '
         'the north or west. And European-Americans who now live in the south '
         'are more genetically similar to African-Americans in the north and '
         'west than they are to African-Americans currently living in the '
         'South—because Blacks with a greater percentage of European ancestry '
         'were more likely to move, especially early in the migration’s '
         'history.\n'
         'The analysis has implications for medical research and treatment. '

         'white, thus potentially leaving gaps in medical information specific '

         'rather than taking after big marine mammals, what if we could learn '
         'from the littler ones, like beavers and otters?\n'
         "“These animals are quite small and they can't carry around a thick "
         'layer of blubber. So instead they have fur that is evolved to trap '
         'air, and this air provides a layer of insulation for them in '
         'water.”\n'
         'Alice Nasto is a graduate student in mechanical engineering at MIT. '

         'works. So Nasto and her colleagues took on the challenge.\xa0\n'
         "“We're creating these furry samples from these rubbery materials by "
         'laser cutting molds and casting these hairy surfaces. And through '
         'our approach we can precisely control the spacing of the hairs [and] '
         'the length of the hairs.” \xa0\xa0\n'
         'The researchers then created a system to gather data when their '
         'pelts entered and moved through a liquid—in this case not water, but '
         'silicone oil, which makes it easier to see air bubbles. The key is '
         'to keep the pelt’s air layer intact.\xa0\n'
         "“So when they're crossing the air water interface, initially their "
         'hairy texture is full of air. And then you go into water. How much '
         "of the air comes down with you as you're moving in through the "
         "interface. So that's what this model will tell you.”\n"
         'They found that the denser the hairs, the more the air gets trapped. '
         'Which should keep the animal—or potentially the human in a future '
         'furry wet suit—warm.\xa0 The research is in the journal Physical '
         'Review Fluids. [Alice Nasto et al., Air entrainment in hairy '
         'surfaces]\n'
         '“What we would like to work on moving forward is understanding how, '

         'Greek for self, auto, and eating, phagein. So, self-eating. '
         'Autophagy refers to a process in cells whereby they destroy '
         'themselves and send the parts out for recycling. Cells do this by '
         'enclosing their contents in tiny sacks, called vesicles. Those '
         'vesicles then get transported to an organelle within the cell called '
         'the lysosome. Where the sacks get degraded and the contents are made '
         'available for reuse.\n'
         'Autophagy had been observed a half-century before Ohsumi’s work in '
         'the 1990’s while at the University of Tokyo. But it was his research '
         'that made clear its fundamental importance. He did that work with '
         'baker’s yeast. One way he made his discoveries was to interfere with '
         'the process and thus see vesicles involved in autophagy start to '
         'build up—this action proved that yeast cells performed autophagy. He '
         'went on to identify 15 genes crucial for the process.\n'
         'Need quick fuel for energy? Autophagy makes that fuel available '
         'fast. Need raw materials for maintenance in other cells? Autophagy '
         'gets those materials into the system so the body can respond to '
         'starvation and other stresses. Infected? Autophagy plays a part in '
         'capturing and killing bacteria and viruses. It clears out damaged '
         'proteins and organelles, thus helping to fight the effects of aging. '

 'text': 'When the Arctic Ocean freezes over in the autumn, polar bears set '
         'off in search of their favorite meals: fatty ringed seals and '
         'bearded seals. By the summer, the sea ice begins to melt and break '
         'apart. Deprived of access to the tasty seals, polar bears spend the '
         "summer fasting. At least, that's what's supposed to happen. As the "
         'planet warms, the warmer ice-free season is getting longer and '
         "longer. So what's a hungry bear to do?\n"
         'Scientists once thought that polar bears might survive by '
         'supplementing their pinniped diet by turning to terrestrial foods '
         'like snow geese, their eggs and caribou.\n'
         '"We\'ve had this debate in the literature about whether terrestrial '
         'foods are nutritionally relevant to polar bears during the on-land '
         'season when the ice has melted.”\n'
         'University of Alberta biologist Nick Pilfold.\n'
         "“And we've known for a long time, going back to research in the "
         'early 70s, even going to back to early explorer logs, that polar '
         'bears will consume terrestrial based foods. But the debate was '
         'always whether those foods actually add up, energetically." In other '
         'words, do these substitutes provide enough nutrition to make up for '
         'the lost seals?\n'
         'To find out, Pilfold and his colleagues estimated the weight lost '
         'each day by polar bears in the wilds of western Hudson Bay during '
         'the ice-free season, when they could ostensibly be chowing down on '
         'terrestrial foods. Then they compared that to the weight lost by '
         "bears that are temporarily held in Manitoba's Polar Bear Alert "
         'Program.\n'
         'While captive, the bears do not eat. They drop about one kilogram '
         'each day. But the wild bears, who had access to the Arctic snack '
         'bar, lost the same amount of weight each day. The results are in the '
         'journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. [Nicholas W. Pilfold '
         'et al., Mass Loss Rates of Fasting Polar Bears]\n'
         '"Which is really saying that the terrestrial foods do not have dense '
         'enough energy to offset the mass loss. So this idea that bears can '
         "just switch from eating sea ice–based food to land food and that's "
         'going to help supplement against longer ice-free seasons, that '
         'really doesn\'t show up in the data."\n'
         'The problem is that polar bears evolved to rely on the marine diet.\n'
         '"The food on land is protein and carbohydrate based, and the food '
         'the polar bears really focus on is fat. Fat is the name of the game '
         "for these bears; they're highly adapted to absorbing that fat into "
         'their system and putting it onto their body as body mass, so they '
         "can fast on it later on. And the only thing that's going to provide "
         'them with that type of fat are marine mammals. And they can only '
         'access those marine mammals when there\'s sea ice."\n'
         'Adult males can go eight months without food. But younger, sub-adult '
         "bears, which are no longer nursing and must hunt, can't last as long "
         'without sea ice. So as the Arctic warms, younger polar bears will '
         'disproportionately die out. Leaving the species’ survival in doubt.\n'

         'field of condensed matter physics. And today’s advanced technology, '
         'take for instance our computers, rely on our ability to understand '

         'set of totally unexpected regularities in the behavior of matter, '
         'which can be described in terms of an established mathematical '

 'text': 'A recent headline on the Web site theverge.com got a lot of '
         'attention on social media. Because each new phrase seemed to take '
         'the message in an unexpected direction. The headline read: U.S. '
         'government plans to use drones to fire vaccine-laced M&Ms near '
         'endangered ferrets.\n'
         'Some background. Black-footed ferrets have been on the endangered '
         'species list since 1967. Only about 300 were known to be alive in '
         'the wild at the end of 2015. They tend to live in the Great Plains '
         'and the West. Because they love to eat prairie dogs, which tend to '
         'live in the Great Plains and the West. Unfortunately, prairie dogs '
         'often harbor fleas, and fleas can carry the plague. Yup, that '
         'plague, the so-called Black Death that killed millions in Europe in '
         'the 14th century.\n'
         'So ferrets suffer when fleas cause a plague outbreak in prairie '
         'dogs, either because the ferrets also catch the disease or because '
         'the prairie dogs die and the ferrets go hungry. Officials have tried '
         'vaccinating individual ferrets and they’ve tried treating '
         'prairie-dog burrows with flea-killer. But neither method is '
         'particularly efficient.\n'
         'And so the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing a study for '
         'September in the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge in Montana. The '
         'viral headline was incorrect about the M&Ms, but otherwise, yes, '
         'aerial drones will shoot vaccine-laced pellets designed to be '
         'irresistible to prairie dogs. The drone delivery system should '
         'quickly spread the vaccine-carrying goodies over a wide area so that '
         'lots of prairie dogs gobble them up—thus making the prairie dogs '
         'available to be gobbled up, safely, by the endangered ferrets.\n'
         'And so everybody wins. Except for the prairie dogs that get eaten. '
         'And the Yersinia pestis bacteria that cause plague. Well, that’s it '

         'And it turns out, that aversion to chickens can be used against the '

         'scroll without unrolling it. They call the technique virtual '
         'unwrapping. Brent Seales explains:\n'
         '“First we have to find the layers within the scanned volume. Finding '
         "evidence of those layers is called segmentation. So there's a "
         'process for that. Once we find those layers we create a texture on '

         'where the ink evidence gets situated onto the layered surface. And '
         'then the final step is this unwrapping where we flatten out that '
         "surface, which is not actually flat, it's three dimensional. So that "
         'we can merge the pieces together and see the completely unwrapped '
         'scroll.”\n'
         'They applied this technique to the Ein Gedi scroll.\n'
         '“So the first time we saw the text was in the lab and of course I '
         "don't speak or read Hebrew but we knew that it was writing because "
         'of the systematic way the markings were lined up, our early versions '
         'were not as clear as what we were able ultimately to produce. But of '
         'course we were elated because we knew that we had a scroll in which '
         'we would see the writing.\n'
         '“But I think the real joy came when Penina sent me back the result '
         'of having read our first results because then I knew that not only '
         'were we seen writing but it was readable because she and her team '
         'were able to identify it as a known text and at that point were '
         'absolutely jubilant I have to say.”\n'
         'The Israeli scholars could clearly read the Hebrew. And they '

 'text': 'A controversial push to expand the US government’s use of commercial '
         'Earth-observing satellites is about to kick into high gear.\n'
         'Early next month, aerospace start-up Spire Global of Glasgow, UK, '
         'will send a mini-satellite into space aboard an Indian government '
         'rocket. This ‘cubesat’ will join 16\xa0others that are beaming a new '
         'type of atmospheric data back to Earth — and some scientists worry '
         'that such efforts are siphoning funding away from efforts to push '
         'forward the science of weather forecasting. Spire will begin '
         'providing observations to the US government on\xa0April 30.\n'
         'The probes track delays in radio signals from Global Positioning '
         'System (GPS) satellites as they pass through the atmosphere — a '
         'technique known as radio occultation. Researchers can use the data '
         'to create precise temperature profiles of the atmosphere to feed '
         'into weather-forecasting models — and eventually, perhaps, climate '
         'models.\n'
         'Spire and its competitor GeoOptics of Pasadena, California, are '
         'participating in a pilot project announced in September by the US '
         'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is '
         'under pressure from the US Congress to determine whether it can cut '
         'costs by using commercial weather data. But scientists worry that '
         'such efforts are hampering the development of radio occultation. For '
         'years, they have sought federal funding for a project to advance the '
         'technique, but Spire and its competitors say they can offer '
         'high-quality data for a fraction of the price.\n'
         '“We are going to provide a lot more observations for less money, and '
         'that is how weather forecasts get better,” says Alexander MacDonald, '
         'a former NOAA meteorologist who now leads Spire’s modelling '
         'program.\n'
         'Scientists at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research '
         '(UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, are poised to begin their own '
         'radio-occultation mission in September, when SpaceX of Hawthorne, '
         'California, will launch six small satellites into orbit over the '
         'tropics. This is the first phase of the Constellation Observing '
         'System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 (COSMIC-2), which '
         'is funded by the US and Taiwanese governments.\n'
         'The US$420-million project seeks to provide the same measurements '
         'that the commercial sector is promising, although with much greater '
         'precision. But its second phase — the launch of polar-orbiting '
         'satellites to ensure global data coverage — has not been funded.\n'
         '“I’m supportive of getting more private companies to provide '
         'satellite information,” says Bill Kuo, who directs COSMIC-2 at UCAR. '
         '“But so far we have not seen that the private sector can provide '
         'this data with the same level of quality and accuracy.”\n'
         'Radio occultation has been used to study weather since 1995, when '
         'scientists at UCAR and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in '
         'Pasadena launched a proof-of-concept mission. The first COSMIC '
         'satellites followed in 2006. Two are still feeding data into '
         'forecasting systems at NOAA and other meteorological agencies, as '
         'are a handful of other satellites.\n'
         'Kuo says that the increased sensitivity of COSMIC-2 will allow '
         'higher-quality measurements that extend through the moisture-rich '
         'lower atmosphere to Earth’s surface. The goal is to determine how '
         'much those advanced data will improve forecasts, he says, but '
         'without the second set of satellites there will be coverage gaps at '
         'high latitudes.\n'
         'Weather forecasters around the world feed about 40\xa0million '
         'environmental measurements into their models each day. Just 2,100 '
         'come from radio occultation, but those data have an oversized impact '
         'on overall accuracy, says Sean Healy, a senior scientist at the '
         'European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, UK. '
         'Ideally, COSMIC-2 would provide global coverage, he says, but '
         'forecasters will take what they can get — including commercial '
         'data.\n'
         'GeoOptics expects to launch its first satellite later this year. '
         'Another firm, PlanetiQ of Boulder, will launch its first two '
         'spacecraft next year. Thanks to falling prices for microelectronics '
         'and space launches, these firms argue that the future of radio '
         'occultation — and potentially other types of Earth observation — '
         'rests with the commercial sector.\n'
         '“We can now put up a constellation of 12\xa0satellites for $15 '
         'million,” says Thomas Yunck, a former engineer at the JPL and '
         'founder of Geo-Optics. Yunck says that the data would become almost '
         'free if the various forecasting centers around the world shared the '
         'cost of operations.\n'
         'A looming question, however, is who will pay for the data. NOAA '
         'makes data from its weather satellites available at no cost, and '
         'agency officials have said that a World Meteorological Organization '
         'resolution would require them to do the same with commercial data '
         'that they receive. So far, the agency has offered Spire and '
         'GeoOptics contracts worth $370,000 and $695,000, respectively, for '
         'the delivery of initial data.\n'
         'The companies say that if NOAA were to purchase their data and give '
         'them away for free, it would have to pay enough to cover the firms’ '
         'costs and ensure a profit. Or the companies could market the data '
         'independently to forecasting centres globally. Either way, they say, '
         'all researchers would have free access to the data.\n'
         '“I don’t consider this insurmountable,” MacDonald says. “It’s going '

 'text': 'Great frigate birds are extraordinary creatures. They’re seabirds '
         'with six-foot wingspans, yet they weigh only about three pounds. '
         'Their preferred food: flying fish—which they pluck out of the air '
         'above the water’s surface. Frigate birds’ feathers aren’t '
         'waterproof, so landing on the water to fish is a no-go.\n'
         'Now, scientists have discovered that great frigate birds do '
         'something else amazing: they can fly for up to two months at a time '
         'without landing.\n'
         'Researchers already knew that these birds took extended trips over '
         'the Indian and Pacific Oceans to feed. But in a new study, '
         'scientists used tracking devices to follow the movement and vital '
         'signs of birds from the island of Europa, near Madagascar. They '
         'discovered that the birds have a highly specialized strategy for '
         'staying aloft.\n'
         '“When they are traveling, most of the time, they flap very '
         'infrequently their wings.\n'
         'Henri Weimerskirch, an ecologist at the National Center for '
         'Scientific Research in France.\n'
         '“In fact, what they are doing, they are doing sort of a roller '
         'coaster flight where they take altitude. Even they can climb up to '
         '3,000 or 4,000 meters, and when they climb, they do not flap their '
         'wings at all.”\n'
         'Weimerskirch and his colleagues found that the birds climb currents '
         'of rising air associated with cumulus clouds, circling upwards the '
         'way hawks and vultures do over land. Then they glide back down '
         'again, hardly flapping. By using atmospheric conditions to their '
         'advantage, the birds covered an average of 420 kilometers a day '
         'almost effortlessly. The study is in the journal Science. [Henri '
         'Weimerskirch et al., Frigate birds track atmospheric conditions over '
         'months-long transoceanic flights]\n'
         'The researchers also discovered that the birds endure some harrowing '
         'conditions on their voyage, including some thrills and chills.\n'
         '“When you enter into the clouds, there’s a lot of turbulence. After, '
         'when you see from the recording on the logger of the bird, when they '
         'are at 4,000 meters, the temperatures are negative. It’s a tropical '
         'bird. It’s a bird that has no specific down like geese that are '
         'operating in the Arctic. So they are encountering sort of a polar '
         'temperature, but it’s a typical tropical bird.”\n'
         'Of course, the birds have to eat during their journey. The '
         'researchers found that diving down to the sea surface to snatch a '
         'meal consumed most of the birds’ energy, even though it only '
         'occupied about 10 percent of their time.\n'
         '“When they are climbing, they have a period where there is no '
         'movement at all during several minutes. And so, during this time is '
         'probably the time when they are sleeping.”\n'
         'That’s right—like many others who make long-distance flights, great '
         'frigate birds catch a little shut-eye along the way.\n'

         'known as the Oregon Territories. Lewis and Clark found massive '
         'numbers of Pacific salmon and steelhead trout there, swimming among '
         'the beaver dams scattered across the Columbia River Basin.\n'
         "But in an effort to starve American interests, Canada’s Hudson's Bay "
         'Company tried to create a "fur desert" by killing off as many '
         'fur-bearing animals as they could. As a result, beavers had all but '
         'disappeared from the area by the year 1900. And once the beavers and '
         'their dams were gone, fish populations dropped.\n'
         'Today, steelhead trout numbers in the region continue to fall. But '
         'scientists and government agencies are working to restore their '
         'habitats.\n'

         "ESA-listed species, but we really don't know what works and what "
         'doesn\'t." Nick Bouwes of the environmental consulting firm Eco '
         'Logical Research and Utah State University.\n'
         'He says that the U.S. spends a billion dollars each year to restore '
         'watersheds, but without any real empirical information to guide '
         'those efforts. So Bouwes and his team tested the idea that by '
         'helping beavers, they could help the fish.\n'
         'Dams naturally alter the flow of streams, providing fish with a '
         'variety of suitable habitats. But the watersheds have become so '
         "degraded that there's not enough woody vegetation available for the "
         'beavers to build strong dams. The flimsy ones they do build get '
         "washed away whenever there's a big storm.\n"
         '"The idea was, can we reinforce these dams so that they maintain '
         'their integrity during high flows, and can be maintained by beavers '
         'to capture that sediment, to reconnect that floodplain?"\n'
         'For seven years, the researchers compared Bridge Creek, which had '
         "lots of artificially strengthened dams, to Murderer's Creek, which "
         'had none. And in Bridge Creek, the fish flourished—despite the view '
         'held by some that beaver dams are bad for fish. The results are in '
         'the journal Scientific Reports. [Nicolaas Bouwes et al, Ecosystem '
         'experiment reveals benefits of natural and simulated beaver dams to '
         'a threatened population of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss)]\n'
         '"Beavers, they’re really good at making a mess of a system, and '
         "it's that messiness that's exactly what we're looking for, by "
         'creating more complex fish habitat."\n'
         'And costing just $11,000 for each kilometer of stream, artificial '
         'dam reinforcements are much cheaper than conventional restoration '
         'methods—since the beavers do most of the work for us. And that is a '

         'Now we have the first hard evidence of ancient Silk Road travelers '

         'The fluke needs snails and fish for its lifecycle, but there were no '
         'such snails or fish in this dry region of china. So the unlucky '

         'really knew how long people were traveling. Some people may have '
         'been trading, only going short distances selling their goods on to '
         'the next person. And so the goods might have gone all the way along '
         'the Silk Road, but people might not. But we know that some people '

         'hundreds of degrees higher than the surroundings. The best way to '

         'University of Florida recorded that titmouse alarm call, made by a '
         'captive individual that had spotted an owl. They then played this '
         'alarm call from speakers mounted in different locations in Florida '

         'U.S. Route 441. Others were more secluded and relatively quiet.\xa0\n'
         'The scientists then observed the reactions of cardinals to these '

         'birds often eavesdrop on the talk of titmice for news of impending '
         'peril.\xa0\n'
         'In the quiet areas, cardinals clearly responded to the titmouse '

         'for predators. But in the noisy places, cardinals paid the warnings '
         'no heed and continued their regular activities.\xa0\n'
         'It’s not completely clear whether the cardinals could not hear the '
         'calls or if they were simply too distracted by the traffic to '
         'respond. Either way, looks like some birds should seek the road less '

         'Carnegie Mellon University—who has never owned a car. "Probably '
         'because I did a whole PhD on engine emissions."\n'
         "Here's how the two injection methods differ. In the old standard, "
         'called "port fuel injection," gas is injected into the air intake, '
         'where it mixes with air before hitting the cylinder. In direct '
         'injection though, as the name implies, the fuel is injected directly '
         "into the cylinder. It's more fuel efficient, meaning lower CO2 "
         'emissions, which will help slow climate change. But paradoxically, '
         'it also emits more particulate matter, including black carbon, or '
         'soot—a pollutant implicated in global warming.\n'
         'Zimmerman and her colleagues analyzed studies of direct injection '

         "customer. She's not there for feline affection, but to probe their "
         'minds.\n'
         'The psychology of domestic cats is still something of a mystery, '

         'many skills, she tells me through an interpreter, that are not well '
         'known even to their owners.\xa0\n'

         'an intuitive understanding of cause-and-effect, but to make it a '
         'fair test, they decided to let the cats use their ears instead of '
         'only their eyes. Cats are ambush hunters, and rely on their sense of '
         'hearing to locate their prey.\n'
         'The cats—30 of them, mostly from cat cafes, plus a few pets—were '
         'shown a series of demonstrations. For example, a researcher would '
         'shake a box, accompanied by the sound of an object bouncing around '
         'inside. Then the cat would be allowed to see inside the '
         'container.\xa0\n'

         'longer if the box turned out to be empty, rather than if the ball '
         'was there as expected. Psychologists call this a "violation of '
         'expectation" response. If they expected a ball and were surprised '
         'not to find one—or vice versa—it suggests that cats have certain '
         'expectations about the physical realities of the world.\xa0\n'
         'And the cats did stare longer at those containers that violated '
         'their expectations, as if to suggest that they realized that '
         'something in the situation was amiss. The findings were published in '
         "the journal Animal Cognition. [Saho Takagi et al., There's no ball "

         "Takagi suspects that this ability might be related to cats' hunting "

         'around as a form of pest control, so it makes sense that cats would '
         'have retained their knack for hunting.\xa0\n'
         'Next, Takagi wants to see just how much information domestic cats '
         'can extract about objects, like quantity or size, based on what they '
         'hear. Eventually, she hopes to do similar experiments with wild cats '

         'now a brewing site some 5,000 years old has been found in China—the '
         'oldest ever found there by a millennium. The remains offer clues not '
         'only to ancient tastes, but to ancient agricultural practices as '
         'well.\n'
         'We had information about ancient Chinese beer brewing from '
         'inscriptions on what are known as oracle bones—pieces of bone or '
         'shell used to try to tell the future. But researchers at a late '
         'Neolithic site in northern China have much more successfully '
         'revealed the past. They came upon two pits in the excavation that '
         'seemed like they were used for brewing. The scientists thought the '
         'shape of the pots would lend themselves to the three stages of '
         'making beer: first brewing, then filtering, and finally storage.\n'
         'So they analyzed the yellowish residue on the inside of the pots. '
         'They found remnants of starch grains—millet, barley, and another '
         'grain called Job’s tears. They also found the remains of tubers such '
         'as yams.\n'
         'And the grains had damage associated with brewing. Some had pits and '
         'channels on the surface, which would come from the sprouting process '
         'during malting. Many had swollen and merged with other grains, which '
         'would happen during mashing when grains are heated in water. The '
         'team found other chemical signatures that point to beer as well.\n'
         'The research is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of '
         'Sciences. [Jiajing Wang et al., Revealing a 5000-year-old beer '
         'recipe in China]\n'
         'The scientists say that the find demonstrates that by 5,000 years '
         'ago the Chinese had developed a complicated recipe and process for '
         'fermenting beer. The find also represents the earliest barley ever '
         'found in China. And the researchers believe that barley was first '
         'introduced to the region to make alcoholic beverages rather than for '
         'food. And that the particular beer they found evidence for might '
         'have played a role in the feasts of the emerging complex society in '
         'the region—one also known as “the cradle of Chinese civilization.”\n'

         'Lee McMillan, second helmsman for the Land Rover Ben Ainslie Racing '
         'America’s Cup team. He was calling one of the races in the America’s '
         'Cup World Series New York session, in the Hudson River on Friday, '
         'May 6th.\n'
         'Before the races, Martin Whitmarsh talked about some of the '
         'technology of these boats. He was a mechanical engineer before '
         'becoming CEO of McLaren Racing and then CEO of the team that will '
         'try to win the America’s Cup for England in 2017. \xa0\n'
         '“We call them boats, we call them yachts, when they’re flying less '
         'than 1 percent of the surface area is in water, 99 percent is in the '
         'air. So these are very aerodynamic boats.”\n'
         '“So we are in a program now which goes towards Bermuda next year for '
         'the 35th America’s Cup challenge. So we are one of the challengers '
         'to Oracle Team USA. And we are in a process here in New York of '
         'competing with what is called an AC-45, so the boats we have here, '
         'they have wings, they’re a hydrofoiling catamaran…but everyone is '
         'using the same boats…and the winner of this series, the World '
         'Series, gets points that go forward into the qualifying process.\n'
         '“At the end of this year, we will launch the Cup Class boats. So '
         'these will be about twice the power...the sailors are down in '
         'cockpits, unlike today. A lot of the power is being generated by '
         'these four grinders that are providing hydraulic power, and that '
         'energy is being used to control the flying surface, the '
         'hydrofoil…and is also being used to control the wing and the flaps, '
         'effectively the engine, of what we have.\n'
         '“So these Cup Class boats…they will be in Bermuda traveling at '
         'speeds of 85 kilometers an hour. These are about 3.5 tons that’ll be '
         'flying on a hydrofoil that’s not much more than a meter wide. So '
         'it’s a fairly incredible piece of technology. And as the sailors '
         'develop their technique you’ll see these staying in the air, jibing '
         'from one hydrofoil onto the other hydrofoil and staying in the air. '
         'It’s an incredible piece of technology, athleticism, and '
         'choreography on the part of the sailors, and skill of course.”\n'
         'The boats that raced in New York—the AC-45s—are 45 feet long and '
         'identical for each team. But there will be some opportunity for '
         'slight differences in the larger AC-72 boats used next year in '
         'Bermuda. And applying advanced technology to those nonfixed areas '
         'could be the difference between winning the Cup or hoping to try '
         'again in 2021.\n'
         '“There’s a lot of challenge…but whilst we’re racing here, there’s a '
         'technology race that’s going on.”\n'

         'information. And they also communicate via a veritable smorgasbord '
         'of stinky secretions they use to mark their territory and advertise '
         'their romantic availability. But male lemurs, which have more scent '

         'sometimes mix their smelly secretions to produce a veritable bouquet '
         'of stank. And now researchers have a better idea why.\n'
         'Male lemurs sometimes use the scent glands on their wrists to mark '
         'tree branches and saplings. Other times, they double down, rubbing '
         'their wrists against glands on their chests to create a foul and '
         'funky fusion. This special blend can then be smeared over objects or '
         'wiped onto their tails, which the males wave at their rivals in a '
         'display that scientists refer to as a “stink fight.”\n'
         'But why create such a custom combination? Perhaps adding the oily '
         'exudate from the chest alters the information conveyed by the wrist. '
         'Or maybe it acts as a kind of preservative that makes the wrist '
         'signal longer lasting.\n'
         'To find out, researchers gathered secretions from a dozen '
         'ring-tailed lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center in North Carolina. They '
         'then presented male lemurs with wooden dowels that were doused with '
         'either the wrist fragrance, the chest scent, or a mixture of the '
         'two. And they found that males spent more time sniffing the stick '
         'with the mixture, which suggests that the fragrant combination does '
         'contain more interesting information than the solo scents alone.\n'
         'But the lemurs were even more interested in the odiferous '
         'amalgamation when it was left out to evaporate for 12 hours, licking '
         'the sticks to better access the dried volatile compounds. That '
         'observation supports the theory that mixing secretions actually '
         'boosts their staying power. The results are in the journal Royal '
         'Society Open Science. [Lydia K. Greene et al, Mix it and fix it: '
         'functions of composite olfactory signals in ring-tailed lemurs]\n'
         'So while a rose is a rose is a rose, the perfume of the ring-tailed '

         'Status, and Changes in Marital Status]\n'
         'Sociologist Jay Teachman, at Western Washington University, examined '

         'Teachman tracked body-mass-index, BMI, a measure of obesity, from '
         'adolescence to middle age. And he analyzed the relationship between '
         'BMI, marital status and changes in marital status. It turned out '
         'that living without a partner usually equated to being thinner and '
         'having a lower BMI compared with married people and couples living '
         'together. The single folks included the never-marrieds and '
         'divorced. \xa0\n'
         'Both men and women gained weight but when it came to race, black '
         'women had the most rapid weight gain, followed by white women and '
         'then black and white men.\xa0\n'
         'The weight gain was just a few pounds—but even a slightly higher BMI '
         'is associated with weight-related health issues.\xa0\n'
         'Several reasons exist for the weight discrepancy between the single '
         'and married people. For example, married men and women may be less '
         'concerned about their body weight because they’re no longer actively '
         'seeking a mate. Plus, married people have a regular dining partner, '

         'widowed or have gone through a divorce may lose weight due to '
         'stress. \xa0\n'

         'welcomed by Bridget Jones. The single, and very weight-conscious, '

         'strength of gravity. It’s tough to measure because gravity is '
         'incredibly weak compared to other fundamental forces.\n'
         '“Big G is a fundamental constant of nature, and as such, I think it '

         'unify general relativity with quantum mechanics in a quantum theory '

         'brainstorm new strategies for measuring Big G.\n'

         'G. Completely new ideas are rare, and this wish may not get '
         'fulfilled. However, when you have a new idea, they can advance the '

         'tough to fit into your skinny jeans? Well, your bacteria may share '
         'some of the blame. Because a new study in mice shows that the '
         'response of intestinal microbes to a high-fat diet ends up '
         'triggering the release of a hormone that makes mammals feel hungry, '
         'causing them to eat even more. The finding is served up in the '
         'journal Nature. [Rachel J. Perry et al., Acetate mediates a '
         'microbiome–brain–β-cell axis to promote metabolic syndrome]\n'
         'Previous work has shown that the types of bacteria in the gut in '
         'diabetic or obese individuals are different from the bacteria in '
         'healthy people. But does this bacterial makeup contribute to these '
         'disorders? Or is it just a side effect?\n'
         'To unravel this mystery, researchers put mice on a high-fat diet. '
         'The animals experienced a buildup of a chemical called acetate, '
         'particularly in the large intestine.\n'
         'That location points to gut bacteria, which can produce acetate, as '
         'a possible culprit. So the researchers wiped out the microbes using '
         'antibiotics or a simple saline wash. And acetate levels plummeted.\n'
         'Okay, so the gut bacteria in fat-fed mice make acetate. What does '
         'acetate do? Well, it gets the involuntary part of the nervous '
         'system, the parasympathetic nervous system, to put out the call to '
         'produce more insulin. Unfortunately, in this case, acetate also gets '
         'the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate production of a '
         'hunger hormone called ghrelin. \xa0And the more fats an animal '
         'consumes, the more acetate it makes—which means the more ghrelin it '
         'produces and, of course, the more it eats. And bacteria make the '
         'whole sequence happen.\n'
         'The researchers are now investigating whether the same biochemical '
         'events happen in humans. If they do, it’s possible that obtaining a '
         'better assortments of gut bacteria could help us control our weight. '
         'Of course, the best way to get those good bacteria is from a fecal '
         'transplant—in which bacteria-rich feces come out of one person and '

         'things like tables and chairs, biological things like cells and '

         'fundamental stuff of nature. I think that tables and chairs are '

         "case there's a cross-protection mutualism between these two species "
         'in which they help to avoid predation."\n'
         'Such cross-protection is usually seen between two animals. But Gore '
         'studies the same sort of mutualism in microbes. He and his team '
         'demonstrated the first experimental example of that cross-protective '
         'relationship in drug-resistant microbes, using two strains of '
         'antibiotic-resistant E. coli bacteria: one resistant to ampicillin, '
         'the other to chloramphenicol.\xa0\n'
         'The researchers grew the bacteria together in a test tube, in the '
         'presence of both antibiotics. And rather than succumbing to the '
         'drugs, each bacterial strain deactivated one of the two '
         'antibiotics—thus protecting the other strain. That activity led to a '
         'stable coexistence over time. Which Gore says could in theory give '
         'the bugs an opportunity to swap resistance genes, through what’s '
         'called horizontal gene transfer—one bacterium donates genetic '
         'material to another. Any such transfer could make either or both '
         'strains individually resistant to both types of antibiotics. The '
         'findings are in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. '

 'text': 'The news last month that gravitational waves had been discovered '
         'made waves throughout the world of science. The finding, from the '
         'Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, showed '
         'that extreme gravity can cause ripples in spacetime. In the case '
         'studied, the extreme gravity came from two colliding black holes. '
         'Now one scientist is suggesting an added wrinkle—that those two '
         'black holes might have originated in a single star.\n'
         '“The situation is similar to a pregnant woman that has twin babies '
         'in her belly.” Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for '
         'Astrophysics. He’s proposing the idea in a paper that’s been '
         'accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. '
         '[Abraham Loeb, Electromagnetic Counterparts to Black Hole Mergers '
         'Detected by LIGO]\n'
         'Loeb became suspicious because just 0.4 seconds after LIGO spotted '
         'the gravitational waves, a space telescope called Fermi glimpsed a '
         'bright flash of gamma-ray light in the same area of the sky.\n'
         '“Detecting such a signal is quite surprising from a collision of two '
         'black holes. What could be the source of a flash of light following '
         'a black hole merger?”\n'
         'Colliding black holes should not produce such light—but the death of '
         'a very massive star could.\n'
         '“My idea was that if the star is spinning very rapidly to start '
         'with, then as its core collapses it produces a bar that breaks into '
         'two clumps of matter, sort of like a dumbbell configuration. And '
         'these two clumps of matter orbit a common center, and they '
         'eventually collapse independently into two black holes.”\n'
         'Of course, it’s possible that the Fermi telescope signal was a false '
         'alarm. So we’ll see if future gravitational wave detections are also '
         'accompanied by flashes of light—supporting the idea that twin black '
         'holes collided upon the collapse of a massive star.\n'

         'from any prying malevolent aliens throughout the cosmos.\n'
         '“Let’s do it—let’s cloak the Earth.”\n'
         'David Kipping, a professor of astronomy at Columbia University who '
         'came up with the idea along with a graduate student, Alex Teachey.\n'
         'DK: “So why would a civilization want to hide?”\n'
         'Teachey:\n'
         'AT: “So a lot of scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have said it '
         'actually might be dangerous for other civilizations out there to '
         'know that we exist. If you look at the history of humanity there '
         'have been cases where two civilizations have come in contact for the '
         'first time, one of these civilizations with a slightly more advanced '
         'technology, and that group has ended up subjugating the other group. '
         'And so, ya know, something like that could happen on a planetary '
         'scale.”\n'
         'Over the past two decades, astronomers have discovered thousands of '
         'planets orbiting other stars. Most of those were found by observing '
         'temporary small decreases in the light coming from those stars due '
         'to a planet passing. That mini-eclipse is called a transit. And it’s '
         'possible that from the point of view of some intelligent aliens the '
         'Earth causes small dips in our sun’s light—telling anyone watching '
         'that we’re here. So how can we hide? By making up for the sunlight '
         'we’re blocking.\n'
         'AT: “And you can do this with lasers—moderately powered lasers. That '
         'might sound a little counter-intuitive because lasers are very '
         'narrow when they are first emitted, but if that light travels across '
         'many light-years that beam widens significantly, and so the beam '
         'width can be on the order of tens of millions of kilometers across '
         'or more, and so any planet lying within that beam would be unable to '
         'see our transit.”\n'
         'Cloaking the Earth from the view of aliens would require firing a '
         '30-megawatt monochromatic laser once per year towards the targeted '
         'star system for the duration of our planet’s transit across the '
         'sun—something not nearly as difficult as it may sound.\n'
         'DK: “The earth’s transit takes about 10 hours, and it does that once '
         'every 365 days. So you could essentially have just a few meters '
         'squared of solar panels collecting sunlight, storing it up, and then '
         'being released at a peak intensity on the order of megawatts for '
         'these ten hour periods. So the actual energy requirements, when you '
         'think about it, over the entire year are very, very low…an '
         'alternative thing you could do is just build a satellite…you’d just '
         'have solar panels about the same sort of size that the ISS, the '
         'International Space Station, has. You would store up that energy '
         'over the course of a year and then you’d release it with a very high '
         'power laser over the course of ten hours once per year.”\n'

         'Society. [David M. Kipping and Alex Teachey, A Cloaking Device for '

         'Of course, the laser cloak could not entirely conceal the Earth or '
         'its life from the rest of the universe. Aliens could always find us '

         'University of Cambridge zoologist Arik Kershenbaum, talking about '
         'his collaborator Holly Root-Gutteridge, a biologist at Syracuse '
         "University. She said to herself, ‘Well, that's wrong. That's clearly "
         'a European wolf and not a North American wolf like it should be in '
         'the scene.\'"\n'
         'Slight variations in the way we speak allow us to tell whether '
         'someone is from Boston or New York just by listening to them. The '
         'same turns out to be true for the animals known as canids, which '
         'includes wolves, dogs and coyotes. They all howl to communicate—but '
         'those howls vary. Canids can tell which howls belong to their known '
         'associates and which belong to strangers.\n'
         'So Kershenbaum and Root-Gutteridge decided to categorize the howls '
         'of different canids around the world. Together with colleagues, they '
         'compiled recordings of more than 2,000 canid howls, including '
         'European wolves, Mexican wolves, arctic wolves, dingoes, coyotes, '
         'golden jackals, domestic dogs, New Guinea singing dogs, and more. A '
         'computer program sorted the howls into different types. The study '
         'was published in the journal Behavioral Processes. [Arik Kershenbaum '
         'et al, Disentangling canid howls across multiple species and '
         'subspecies: Structure in a complex communication channel]\n'
         'Based on the analysis, canids use 21 different kinds of howls to '
         'communicate. If you think of the howls as words, then all canids '
         'have the same vocabulary—but each species or sub-species has its own '
         'unique dialect. Some words are more common in one dialect, while '
         'other words are more common in another dialect and so on. By '
         'matching dialect with species and geography, researchers could '
         'monitor endangered species, like red wolves, just by listening.\n'
         '[AK:] "Being able to distinguish between the howls of a coyote and '
         'the howls of a red wolf opens the possibility for techniques of '
         'passive monitoring, passive population monitoring, using '
         'acoustics."\n'
         'Meanwhile, ranchers have tried to broadcast specific howls to '
         "discourage grey wolves from feasting on their livestock, but it's "
         'never been successful.\n'
         '[AK:] "Because we don\'t really know what message we\'re conveying '
         'to the wolves when we play back an arbitrary howl. For all we know, '
         "we could be playing back a howl that means come and eat, there's "
         'lots of interesting food over here."\n'
         'The research could thus finally bring peace to the conflict between '
         'ranchers and wolves, by finally speaking to the predators in their '

         'computing with any number of things." Including, he says, DNA.\n'

         'the logic gates, the memory, and other systems found in conventional '
         'computers.\xa0\n'

         'open-source design environment called "Cello." Just write what you '
         'want the cell to do, and Cello spits out the DNA sequence—as if you '
         'were compiling code. The researchers used the platform to design 60 '
         'genetic circuits, which they then ran inside E. coli bacteria. Many '

         'Not all the circuits worked as intended. A quarter of them failed, '

         'At high speeds, the ball may appear to the hitter to rise. Of '
         'course, the ball is actually still going down due to gravity as it '
         'approaches the plate from any pitcher throwing overhand, no matter '

         'saw the movie that, for some hitters facing the very hardest '
         'throwers, the ball can completely disappear.\n'
         '“The idea of the ball disappearing was really fascinating to me. '

         'Which is exactly the distance, the amount of time that it basically '
         'takes to swing, like 0.17 [seconds] for the swing. So if you’re '

 'text': 'Florida’s Everglades are home to lots of large wading birds, like '
         'egrets and herons. But the ‘Glades also have lots of raccoons and '
         'possums. For the mammals, the birds’ nests are an all-you-can-eat '
         'buffet. And when an invasion occurs, "sometimes thousands of birds '
         "will abandon their nests, and just leave, and there's littered "
         'remains of dead chicks and eggs that have been eaten." Lucas Nell, '
         'an ecologist at the University of Georgia.\n'
         'Nell says that, in order to seek protection from their furry foes, '
         'birds actually prefer to build their nests in plots of swamp with a '
         'resident alligator. In fact, in one study a graduate student planted '
         'fake alligators. And the birds seemed to prefer to build nests close '
         'to them. "Where there\'s a water source, there are alligators, so '
         'it\'s sort of this moat of protection around these colonies."\xa0\n'
         'Nell and his colleagues took to the Everglades at night, hunting for '
         'gators near and far from nests. "You have to use a spotlight and you '
         'see the little demon eyes shining out of the marsh." They lassoed '
         'the gators, pulled them into the airboat, and took blood samples and '
         'body measurements.\xa0\n'
         'Turns out the gators near bird colonies were 13 percent fatter. '
         'Which means this unusual arrangement may be mutually beneficial. The '
         'birds get protection. And the alligators? They feast on any chicks '
         'that get kicked out of the nest, as well as on the rest of the '
         'extra-productive swamp life, fertilized by all that guano. The '
         'findings are in the journal PLoS ONE. [Lucas A. Nell et al, Presence '

         'There is one drawback for adult birds who stray too close to their '
         'bodyguard: Gators are not discriminating diners. "I liken it less to '

         'Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It started off '
         'with a bang, when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted in January. And it '
         'tailed off with a shudder, when a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck '
         'the region in October. Both events devastated local communities—and '
         'their close timing struck some scientists as suspicious.\n'
         '“We were wondering if there was a link—so, a causality—between those '
         'two major geological events.”\n'
         'Christelle Wauthier, a geologist at Pennsylvania State University.\n'
         'From studying radar images of the ground taken before and after the '
         'January eruption, Wauthier knew that lava didn’t just spew out of '
         'the volcano. It also wedged itself into cracks in the crust, forming '
         'what geologists call a dike.\xa0\n'
         '“You can think of it as like a blade-shaped type of magma intrusion, '
         'moving from depth toward the surface. It’s very fast, a few hours, a '
         'few days, and it can penetrate tens of kilometers of crust.”\n'
         'Dikes are common in rift zones, like east Africa and Iceland, where '
         'tectonic forces are slowly ripping Earth’s crust apart. And they’re '
         'known to cause small earthquakes right when they happen. But '
         'Wauthier wondered if dikes might also be capable of triggering large '
         'earthquakes by pushing the ground apart and affecting nearby '
         'faults.\xa0\n'
         '“You will add more stress on a weakness surface, which is a fault. '
         'And so if you add enough stress on it, you can trigger failure on '
         'the fault.”\n'
         'Now, Wauthier and her colleagues have used a model to show that the '
         'stress changes caused by the January dike event made the October '
         'earthquake much more likely to occur. The results are in the journal '
         'Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems. [C. Wauthier, et al, '

         'border fault: The 2002 Nyiragongo‐Kalehe sequence, D.R. Congo]\n'
         'This study marks the first time scientists have linked dike '
         'formation to large, damaging earthquakes, and Wauthier is looking '
         'back through history for more examples. She says researchers will '
         'never be able to predict exactly when an earthquake might strike '
         'after a dike intrusion. But at least now, researchers and rift zone '
         'residents know they’re not just in for bangs—they may also be in for '

         'hibernation. And in case you’re wondering, they went in and got the '
         'stuff before it even hit the ground. If you get my drift. \xa0\n'
         'An analysis of the excrement showed that bears’ summer bacteria are '
         'more diverse and include species that tend to promote energy '
         'storage. What’s more, when the researchers stripped mice of their '
         'own microbes and gave them the bacteria from bears, the rodents that '
         'received the summer sampler got fatter than those with the winter '
         'set—evidence that the microbiome is indeed affecting metabolism. The '
         'results appear in the journal Cell Reports. [Felix Sommer et al, The '
         'Gut Microbiota Modulates Energy Metabolism in the Hibernating Brown '
         'Bear Ursus arctos]\n'
         'The researchers do not yet know whether fiddling with our own gut '
         'bacteria could help us shed excess weight. Or whether any such '
         'microbial diet plan would necessitate a very long winter’s nap.\n'

         'your roomiest sweatpants and your own personal Family-size bag of '
         'Nacho Cheese Doritos. But if you’re at all concerned about '
         'overindulging—which, if you live in America, you probably should '
         'be—you might take a tip from a public health advocate at the New '
         'York City Food Policy Center. Charles Platkin says that one way to '
         'avoid overdoing it is to consider how much you’d have to exercise to '
         'work off what you consume.\n'
         'So to prepare for Super Bowl Sunday—the second biggest day for food '
         'consumption in the U.S.—Platkin crunched the numbers for some of our '
         'favorite couch-side snacks. And he’s helpfully converted them into '
         'football-themed exercise equivalents.\n'
         'So, for example, two slices of Domino’s ultimate pepperoni '
         'hand-tossed crust pizza would require running nearly 11,000 '
         'yards—that’s 109 football fields—at a speed of five miles per hour.\n'
         'Two KFC original drumsticks? Just do the wave 1,561 times.\n'
         'To pay for a single potato chip loaded with French onion dip you’d '
         'have to sing along with Coldplay and Beyonce for 30 minutes during '
         'halftime.\n'
         'And even five pretzels—yes, puny little pretzels out of a bag—would '
         'take six-and-a-half minutes of jumping up and down whenever your '
         'team scores a touchdown.\n'
         'Which means that if you want to avoid post-bowl paunch, your team '
         'better bring it. Either that or just stick with the celery sticks. '
         'And pass on the dip, if you want to maintain the current size of '
         'your end zone.\n'
